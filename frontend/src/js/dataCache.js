Sudanese man, tells police in Sarasota, Florida, he is concerned that a friend of his may pose a threat to President Bush, who is spending the night on nearby Longboat Key and is due to visit Sarasota today. After he contacts the Sarasota police, Omer is visited by some officers. He tells them that on the previous evening he talked to a friend of his, who he identifies only as \u201cGandi.\u201d He says Gandi is in Sarasota with two companions, with the intention of getting a friend of theirs out of jail. Omer is apparently concerned that Gandi may be a danger to Bush while he is visiting the area. He says Gandi \u201chas made several remarks in the past that indicated extremely violent thoughts.\u201d He adds that, considering the man\u2019s \u201cpast inclinations,\u201d the fact that Gandi is in Sarasota at the time Bush is visiting the area \u201cmight not be coincidental.\u201d The Sarasota police officers will contact the Secret Service, whose agents then question Omer about his concerns. Police officers and Secret Service agents will visit an address on 32nd Street in Sarasota, where they find 11 Arab men apparently at morning prayer. One of the men has a card for the Longboat Key Club, which is near the resort where Bush has been spending the night .  </p>", "image": "", "image_caption": "", "approved": true, "media_type": "html",

Calls made to the number are routed to the first available phone station at one of several facilities, including the office in Cary.  <br/><u>Ong Tells Agent, 'We're Being Hijacked'</u> - The call is answered by Vanessa Minter, a reservation agent. The first thing Ong says is, \u201cI think we\u2019re being hijacked.\u201d  Minter will later reflect: \u201cThere was something in her voice that said: \u2018Okay, this isn\u2019t funny. This isn\u2019t a joke. This is real.\u2019\u201d  <br/><u>Resolution Agent Joins Call</u> - Minter asks Ong to hold for a moment. She then phones the American Airlines international resolution desk, which is on the other side of the building. Winston Sadler, the resolution agent, answers, and Minter tells him she has a woman on the phone who is calling from an American Airlines flight that is being hijacked. Minter says she cannot find the \u201cemergency button\u201d on her phone, and Sadler notices that she seems panicked. He offers to take over the call, and so Minter transfers it to him. The phone system allows Sadler to be connected to Minter\u2019s line while Minter remains on it. <br/><u>Alarm Sent Out to Notify Supervisor</u> - Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Sadler pushes the emergency button on his phone, which initiates a tape recording of Ong\u2019s call and also sends out an alarm that notifies Nydia Gonzalez, a supervisor at the reservations office, to pick up the call. Gonzalez will join the call from Ong a short time later , and in it Ong will relay crucial information about what is happening on her plane.  However, only the first four minutes of the call are recorded. This is because the recently installed recording system at the reservations office has a default time limit.

Global Guardian is an annual exercise sponsored by US Strategic Command (Stratcom) in cooperation with US Space Command and NORAD. One military author defines Stratcom as \u201cthe single US military command responsible for the day-to-day readiness of America\u2019s nuclear forces.\u201d  <br/><u>Exercise Tests Military's Ability to Fight a Nuclear War</u> - Global Guardian is a global readiness exercise involving all Stratcom forces and aims to test Stratcom\u2019s ability to fight a nuclear war. It is one of many \u201cpractice Armageddons\u201d that the US military routinely stages.  It links with a number of other military exercises, including Crown Vigilance (an Air Combat Command exercise), Apollo Guardian (a US Space Command exercise), and the NORAD exercises Vigilant Guardian and Amalgam Warrior.  Global Guardian is both a command post and a field training exercise, and is based around a fictitious scenario designed to test the ability of Stratcom and its component forces to deter a military attack against the US. Hundreds of military personnel are involved.  The exercise involves \u201ca lot of the elements of what ultimately would be the nuclear command and control system in support of a national emergency,\u201d according to Admiral Richard Mies, the commander in chief of Stratcom. It includes an \u201cexercise secretary of defense\u201d and \u201can exercise president.\u201d Mies will say that because of the exercise, \u201cA lot of [Stratcom\u2019s] command and control systems that, in peacetime, are normally not on alert were at a much, much higher state of alert [on September 11] and we had a number of aircraft, manned control aircraft that were airborne that were simulating their wartime roles.\u201d  <br/><u>Exercise Normally Held in October or November</u> - According to a 1998 Internet article by the British American Security Information Council\u2014an independent research organization\u2014Global Guardian is held in October or November each year.  In his book <i>Code Names</i>, NBC News military analyst William Arkin dates this exercise for October 22-31, 2001.  And a military newspaper reported in March 2001 that Global Guardian was scheduled for October 2001.  If this is correct, then some time after March, the exercise must have been rescheduled for early September. <br/><u>Exercise Includes a 'Computer Network Attack'</u> - Furthermore, a 1998 Defense Department newsletter reported that for several years Stratcom had been incorporating a computer network attack (CNA) into Global Guardian. The attack involved Stratcom \u201cred team\u201d members and other organizations acting as enemy agents, and included attempts to penetrate the command using the Internet and a \u201cbad\u201d insider who had access to a key command and control system. The attackers \u201cwar dialed\u201d the phones to tie them up and sent faxes to numerous fax machines throughout the Command. They also claimed they were able to shut down Stratcom\u2019s systems. Reportedly, Stratcom planned to increase the level of computer network attack in future Global Guardian exercises.  It is unclear if a computer network attack is incorporated into Global Guardian in 2001. </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/802_global_guardian_2050081722-9716-1.jpg", "image_caption": "Offutt Air Force Base control tower during Global Guardian 1998.

Bueno says, \u201cI have a situation with American 11, a possible hijack.\u201d He adds that Flight 11 \u201cdeparted Boston, going to LAX [Los Angeles International Airport]. Right now he\u2019s south of Albany.\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019d like to scramble some fighters to go tail him.\u201d Spence replies that he will contact Otis Air Base about the situation, and tells Bueno, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to these guys over here and see what we can do.\u201d Bueno then adds that Flight 11 is currently airborne, is about 40 miles south of Albany, and is visible only on primary radar.  Bueno also calls the air traffic control tower at Otis Air Base around this time, to alert it to Flight 11 and request military assistance .  <br/><u>Bueno Supposedly Violating Protocol</u> - Bueno will say he decided to call the Cape TRACON based on his memory of a previous aircraft hijacking.  But according to the 9/11 Commission Report, by trying to get military assistance through the TRACON, the \u201cBoston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed chain of command.\u201d  Indeed, Bueno will tell the 9/11 Commission that he knows his call should instead be to NEADS, \u201cbut due to the urgency of the circumstance [he] called directly to the FAA contact point for Otis.\u201d  And Spence will tell the Commission that arranging for fighters to be scrambled in response to a hijacking \u201cis not the typical responsibility of an operations supervisor with the FAA,\u201d like himself. He will also say that it is \u201cunusual for the [air traffic control] centers to contact TRACON for information. Normally the FAA receives the call from the military for a scramble, but this time it went the other way around, and then the official order came back down from the military.\u201d  <br/><u>Bueno Praised by Colleagues for Actions</u> - However, according to the 9/11 Commission, \u201cBueno gets high marks\u201d from the Boston Center personnel it interviews, \u201cfor instinctively calling FAA traffic approach personnel at the location where he knew the fighters to be\u2014Otis [Air National Guard Base].\u201d Even Colin Scoggins, the Boston Center\u2019s military liaison, \u201cwho knew that the call had to go to NEADS, did not fault Bueno for trying to call the Air Force wing directly through other FAA personnel.\u201d  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/Cape_TRACON_2050081722-9232.jpg", "image_caption": "Cape TRACON.

Marquis now instructs Halleck, \u201cTell [air traffic control] to handle this as an emergency.\u201d According to a 9/11 Commission memorandum, \u201cAt this point, Marquis was just confirming it was a hijack and he wanted to make sure Halleck was communicating the emergency to the [air traffic control] system.\u201d Halleck answers that FAA controllers are treating Flight 11 as a hijacking, saying, \u201cThey have in there, it\u2019s been hijacked.\u201d Marquis replies: \u201cIt is.

Lieutenant Colonel Steven Armstrong, NORAD\u2019s chief of plans and forces, will recall, \u201c[W]e didn\u2019t really know that it was anything other than perhaps a general aviation aircraft because those were the first indications that we had was it was just\u2026 reported like a small, maybe a general aviation aircraft that had hit one of the buildings.\u201d  According to Lieutenant Colonel William Glover, the commander of NORAD\u2019s Air Warning Center: \u201c[W]e weren\u2019t sure whether it was a mistake\u2026 was this intentional? Was there a problem? The weather was good, you know, that type of thing. So we really didn\u2019t know what the reason was that this aircraft struck the tower.\u201d  Ford will recall: \u201c[W]e knew something was wrong because there really wasn\u2019t any reason for any navigational problems for that aircraft. There might have been a malfunction or something on the aircraft that had taken place, but we really didn\u2019t have any indications of what was going on yet.\u201d  <br/><u>CMOC Personnel Unaware that Crash Was Deliberate</u> - The CMOC is \u201cthe nerve centre of North America\u2019s air defense,\u201d according to the BBC.  Its role, according to the Toronto Star, is \u201cto fuse every critical piece of information NORAD has into a concise and crystalline snapshot.\u201d  But it is only after personnel there see the television coverage of the second plane hitting the WTC at 9:03 a.m. that they realize \u201cwe had something much more sinister than just an accident, a really coordinated and deliberate action,\u201d according to Findley.  Armstrong will recall: \u201c[W]hen we saw the video [of the second crash], we said: \u2018Wait a second. Those are commercial-size airplanes. Those aren\u2019t general aviation aircraft.\u2019 That obviously changed the situation significantly.\u201d  According to Glover, after the second crash, \u201cWe knew then that the first one was not a mistake and we knew that this was intentional.\u201d  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/275_rick_findley.jpg", "image_caption": "Major General Rick Findley.

The NCS is a relatively small government agency that works to ensure the availability of critical communications networks during times of crisis.  <br/><u>Center Conducts Non-Stop Operations</u> - An NCS publication will later describe, \u201cImmediately,\u201d in response to the attacks, \u201cthe NCC began non-stop operations to support NS/EP [national security and emergency preparedness] communications between federal, state, and local responders, to restore damaged communications lines in Arlington, Virginia, and New York City, and to provision new lines for the recovery and investigation activities.\u201d The NCC operates at four sites: the NCC itself, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Defense Department\u2019s Global Network Operations Support Center headquarters, and a remote \u201ccontinuity of operations\u201d location. Brenton Greene, the director of the NCS, goes to his \u201cContinuity of Government\u201d site, where personnel operate around the clock to monitor the status of the telecommunications network, and coordinate priorities and repairs. The NCS, which is part of the Department of Defense, also deploys military reservists to three FEMA regional operations centers. <br/><u>Time Center Activated at Unclear</u> - Greene will tell the 9/11 Commission that the NCC is activated at 8:48 a.m.  However, other accounts will indicate that the center is not activated until later on. According to journalist and author Dan Verton, Greene\u2014who is attending a briefing on the terrorist threat to the US\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure, apparently at the NCC\u2014initially believes the first plane hit the World Trade Center by accident, and therefore orders the briefing to continue . It is only when the second plane hits the WTC at 9:03 a.m. that he realizes \u201cthere was some threat,\u201d and responds to the crisis.  Counterterrorism \u201ctsar\u201d Richard Clarke will write that he himself gives the instruction to activate the NCS, at around 12:30 p.m. Then, according to Clarke, his colleague Paul Kurtz calls Greene and instructs him to tell all the major telephone companies that \u201cthey need to support Verizon.\u201d  <br/><u>Center Coordinates Emergency Communications during Crises</u> - The NCS was established by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, in order to provide better communications support to critical government functions during emergencies. An executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 broadened the NCS\u2019s capabilities, and listed its duties as \u201cthe planning for and provision of national security and emergency preparedness communications for the federal government under all circumstances, including crisis or emergency, attack, recovery, and reconstitution.\u201d  The NCS consists of 22 federal agencies, 100 full-time civilian employees, and 10 military employees.  The mission of the NCC is to assist \u201cin the initiation, coordination, restoration, and reconstitution of national security or emergency preparedness telecommunications services or facilities under all conditions of crisis or emergency.\u201d The center is composed of members from the US government and the telecommunications industry.  There are 150 private sector contractors from 21 companies working at the NCC.  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/NCS_logo_2050081722-36612.jpg", "image_caption": "Logo of the National Communications System.

After the center\u2019s manager informs them that a plane has crashed into the WTC, personnel at the system engineer\u2019s desk turn on CNN and see the footage of the burning North Tower. Scoggins hears yelling from the desk and walks over to see what is going on. He sees the news reports, which currently state that just a small aircraft hit the tower. As author Lynn Spencer will describe: \u201cHis initial thought is that some controller must have really screwed up. Yet the more he thinks about it, the less that makes sense. It\u2019s a clear day with unlimited visibility, and planes don\u2019t just fly into buildings.\u201d Along with supervisor Daniel Bueno, Scoggins starts contacting other facilities, trying to find out more about what is going on. Several of these facilities are picking up an aircraft\u2019s emergency locator transmitter\u2014a device which begins transmitting a signal when a plane crashes. But Boston Center lacks the necessary equipment to pinpoint where the signal is coming from. Looking again at the TV footage showing the WTC, Scoggins wonders if Flight 11 crashed into the tower. He tells Bueno, \u201cCall American [Airlines] and confirm if their aircraft is down!\u201d Bueno complies, but soon reports back that American Airlines \u201ccan\u2019t confirm that the plane that has hit the Trade Center is American 11. They\u2019ve lost their radar track on the plane and cannot confirm where it is.\u201d  Scoggins will later recall that American Airlines does not confirm that its plane has hit the North Tower for several hours.

Midwest Airlines Flight 7 (Midex 7) is a DC-9 jet bound from Milwaukee to New York\u2019s La Guardia Airport, with about 30 passengers and five crew members on board.  Pilot Gerald Earwood and co-pilot Eric Fjelstad have been concerned at the unusually slow radio responses they have been receiving from New York air traffic controllers.  As they are approaching La Guardia from the southwest, Earwood is again frustrated as he awaits the controller\u2019s response to his latest transmission.  <br/><u>Instructed to Turn Left</u> - Suddenly, the voice of a panicked controller comes over the radio: \u201cMidex 7, are you with me? <i>Midex 7, Midex 7, are you with me?</i>\u201d Unknown to Earwood, controllers have noticed that Flight 175 is now flying directly at his plane at over 500 miles per hour. Earwood replies, \u201cMidex 7 is with you out of 7 for 4,000,\u201d meaning he has just passed through 7,000 feet in his descent to his assigned altitude of 4,000 feet. The controller orders: \u201cRoger, Midex 7, turn left now! Head two-four-zero degrees now, as quick as you can!\u201d The pilots of Midex 7 begin a standard 30-degrees-of-bank turn. But even though they are doing exactly what they have been ordered to, the controller continues, \u201cLeft turn, Midex, <i>left turn!</i>\u201d Several seconds later, the controller restates his order: \u201cMidex 7, tighten it up! <i>Roll left! Now! Now! Now!</i>\u201d Earwood looks out of the window for the plane he is meant to be avoiding, but cannot see anything. <br/><u>Narrowly Avoids Collision</u> - As Midex 7 is completing its left turn, the controller comes back over the radio even more panicked than before, ordering: \u201d<i>Roll right, Midex! Roll right as hard as you can!</i> Keep it tight, Midex. Roll hard right! <i>Now! Now!</i>\u201d Midex 7 complies with the instruction, but Earwood is wondering where the plane is that he is trying to avoid. At the FAA\u2019s New York Center, air traffic controllers watch as the radar returns for Flight 175 and Midex 7 get so close that they appear to merge on the screens. Finally, Flight 175 continues its rapid descent toward New York, after having narrowly avoided a collision.  Midex 7 returns to its approach to La Guardia Airport, and then Earwood overhears a radio transmission from another pilot, who reports that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center. Earwood will later estimate that Flight 175 crashes into the South Tower 60 to 90 seconds after its near-collision with Midex 7. He sees the fireball coming from the tower, but does not immediately connect it with the aircraft he has just avoided.  Minutes earlier, Flight 175 almost collided with at least two other planes as it descended toward Manhattan .  The incident with Midex 7 will not come to light until 2008, when it is described in the book <i>Touching History: The Untold Story of the Drama that Unfolded in the Skies Over America on 9/11</i>, by Lynn Spencer.  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/Gerald_Earwood_2050081722-26174.jpg", "image_caption": "Gerald Earwood.

According to author Lynn Spencer: \u201cATC zero is designed for situations in which an air traffic facility is completely incapable of handling aircraft due to a massive computer failure, power outage, or even a large enough weather system. The declaration pushes all their aircraft onto neighboring sectors, and any new airplanes from adjacent sectors are turned back, at the sector boundaries if necessary.\u201d  The decision to declare ATC zero is made after the second plane hits the World Trade Center, confirming that the US is under terrorist attack. There are currently hundreds of aircraft in the skies around New York and the western Atlantic that the New York Center is responsible for.  Bruce Barrett, a senior manager at the New York Center, announces, \u201cWe\u2019re declaring ATC zero,\u201d and Mike McCormick, the center\u2019s air traffic control manager, approves the order. Several of the managers there then start informing air traffic controllers of the decision. <br/><u>Unprecedented Order</u> - USA Today will report that this decision is unprecedented: \u201cControllers had gone to \u2018air traffic control zero\u2019 before, but only when their radar shut down or their radio transmitters went silent. The planes kept flying then, and controllers in other centers guided them. This time, ATC zero means something far more drastic. It means emptying the skies\u2014something that has never been attempted. And not just the skies over Manhattan. Controllers must clear the air from southern New England to Maryland, from Long Island to central Pennsylvania\u2014every mile of the region they control.\u2026 Controllers from Cleveland to Corpus Christi must reroute jets headed to the region and put some in holding patterns.\u201d <br/><u>Accounts Conflict over Whether Center Seeks Permission</u> - According to USA Today, McCormick and Barrett declare ATC zero without first seeking permission from higher-ups, because a \u201ccall to Washington could take minutes, and they aren\u2019t sure they have that long.\u201d  But according to Lynn Spencer, a New York Center supervisor has already requested ATC zero in a call to the FAA\u2019s Herndon Command Center. Ben Sliney, the Command Center\u2019s national operations manager, assured the supervisor, \u201cYou take care of matters in your center and we will provide all the assistance necessary by stopping any further aircraft from entering your airspace.\u201d  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/Bruce_Barrett_2050081722-26203.jpg", "image_caption": "Bruce Barrett.

Just that they <i>can</i> collapse.\u201d  But other firefighters do not appear to have shared this concern.

This could be referring to this second call, which occurred while Deena was on the phone with the FBI agent.  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/b254_mark_rothenberg_2050081722-9117.jpg", "image_caption": "Mark Rothenberg.

At the time of the attack, Rumsfeld is in his office proceeding with his regularly scheduled CIA briefing, despite being aware of the two attacks on the World Trade Center earlier on. Waiting outside his door is Officer Aubrey Davis of the Pentagon police, who is assigned to the defense secretary\u2019s personal bodyguard and has come of his own initiative to move Rumsfeld to a better-protected location. According to Davis, there is \u201can incredibly loud \u2018boom,\u2019\u201d as the Pentagon is struck. Just 15 or 20 seconds later, Rumsfeld walks out of his door looking composed, having already put on the jacket he normally discards when in his office. Davis informs him there is a report of an airplane hitting a section of the Pentagon known as the Mall. Rumsfeld sets off without saying anything or informing any of his command staff where he is going, and heads swiftly toward the Mall. Davis accompanies him, as does Rumsfeld\u2019s other security guard Gilbert Oldach, his communications officer, and the deputy director of security for the secretary\u2019s office. Finding no sign of damage at the Mall, Davis tells Rumsfeld, \u201c[N]ow we\u2019re hearing it\u2019s by the heliport,\u201d which is along the next side of the building. Despite Davis\u2019s protests that he should head back, Rumsfeld continues onward, and they go outside near where the crash occurred.  The Pentagon was hit on the opposite site of the huge building to Rumsfeld\u2019s office.  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke will say that Rumsfeld is \u201cone of the first people\u201d to arrive at the crash scene.  He spends a brief time there .  Rumsfeld will later justify his actions following the attack, saying, \u201cI was going, which seemed to me perfectly logically, towards the scene of the accident to see what could be done and what had happened.\u201d  As journalist Andrew Cockburn will point out, though, \u201c[T]he country was under attack and yet the secretary of defense disappears for 20 minutes.\u201d  John Jester, the chief of the Defense Protective Service, which guards the Pentagon, will criticize Rumsfeld for heading to the crash scene at this time. He will say: \u201cOne of my officers tried to stop him and he just brushed him off. I told [Rumsfeld\u2019s] staff that he should not have done that. He is in the national command authority; he should not have gone to the scene.\u201d  The numerous reports of Rumsfeld going outside to the crash scene are apparently contradicted by counterterrorism \u201ctsar\u201d Richard Clarke. In his 2004 book  <i>Against All Enemies</i>, Clarke will give the impression that Rumsfeld never leaves a video conference for very long after the Pentagon is hit, except to move from one secure teleconferencing studio to another elsewhere in the Pentagon.  However, video footage confirms that Rumsfeld does indeed go to the crash site.  </p>", "image": "", "image_caption": "", "approved": true, "media_type": "html", "duration": 120, "start": 34680, "end": 34800, "vidid": "mb6ea54475f977c1c5a54fa26dd4f9281"}, {"id": 16572, "start_date": "2001-09-11T09:38:00Z", "end_date": "2001-09-11T09:40:00Z", "calc_duration": 0, "sort": 0, "title": "Some Officers in Area Where Pentagon Is Hit Think Bombs Have Exploded", "source": "History Commons", "full_title": "9:38 a.m. September 11, 2001: Some Officers in Area Where Pentagon Is Hit Think Bombs Have Exploded - History Commons\r", "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a938bombsexploded#a938bombsexploded", "format": "html", "jump": 0, "trim": 0, "volume": "1.00", "mute": false, "content": "<p>At least three Pentagon employees in the area of the building that is hit, and who narrowly survive the attack, initially believe that what they have experienced is a bomb, or bombs, going off: <br/><img alt=\"bullet\" height=\"8\" src=\"http://www.historycommons.org/pics/childbullet.gif\" width=\"5\"/> John Thurman, an Army lieutenant colonel, is in a second floor office just above where the Pentagon is hit.

Rumsfeld has a crucial role to play in coordinating the military response to an attack on the US. According to journalist and author Andrew Cockburn, since the Cold War, \u201cIn an age when an enemy attack might allow only a few minutes for detection and reaction, control of American military power became vested in the National Command Authority, which consists of the president and the secretary of defense. Collectively, the NCA is the ultimate source of military orders, uniquely empowered, among other things, to order the use of nuclear weapons. In time of war, therefore, Rumsfeld was effectively the president\u2019s partner, the direct link to the fighting forces, and all orders had to go through him. Such orders were supposed to be transmitted from\u2026 the National Military Command Center.\u201d Cockburn adds that the NMCC is \u201cthe operational center for any and every crisis, from nuclear war to hijacked airliners.\u201d Yet, rather than join the NMCC conference, Rumsfeld has already gone out of the Pentagon to see the crash site, without telling any of his command staff where he was going, and remains out of contact for some time . Therefore, a few minutes after Leidig makes his request, Rumsfeld\u2019s office will report back that he is nowhere to be found. Cockburn concludes, \u201cThe chain of command was broken.\u201d  It is unknown whether Rumsfeld has a cell phone or pager on him, and if so, why he cannot be reached. </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/321_rumsfeld_after_crash2050081722-9231.jpg", "image_caption": "This picture of Rumsfeld (center), taken from the US Army website, is captioned, \u201cSecretary of Defense Donald H.

In response to the report, the fire communications center dispatches a \u201cbox alarm\u201d from Engine Company 16, the station that serves the White House.  A box alarm consists of four engines, two trucks, a rescue company, and a battalion chief.  Since the alleged incident is at the White House\u2014the home of the US president\u2014the response is increased by sending an additional battalion chief and the deputy fire chief, Rogers Massey, to deal with it. And because a building collapse has been reported, the DCFD\u2019s cave-in task force, which comprises Rescue 3, Battalion Chief 3, Engine 15, and the hazmat (hazardous materials) task force, is also sent.

Its members respond to situations that require the most specialized training, such as hostage taking and water rescue, and use the most advanced equipment.  <br/><u>Officers Are Ordered to Come Down from the WTC</u> - Inspector Ronald Wasson, commanding officer of the ESU, earlier on divided his officers into four teams of five or six men and then sent two teams into each of the Twin Towers to assist the rescue operation.  But now, ESU commanders give the order for the unit\u2019s members to \u201cgo tactical.\u201d This means the officers in the towers have to come out of the buildings and go to the unit\u2019s SWAT (special weapons and tactics) vans; put on their BDU (battle dress uniform) suits, flak jackets, and Kevlar helmets; and arm themselves with heavy weapons and assault rifles. <br/><u>Commander Thinks Terrorists Might Attack the First Responders</u> - The decision to order ESU officers to go tactical is made by Wasson, according to a book by Lieutenant William Keegan of the Port Authority Police Department.  Wasson is currently assembled with a number of other ESU officers outside the Twin Towers, at the corner of West and Vesey Streets.  He decides that ESU officers should go tactical due to his concern that armed terrorists might attack the first responders at the WTC. He is \u201cworried that with all his personnel inside the buildings, he [has] no way to protect the cops, firefighters, or civilians from the kind of low-intensity warfare\u2014snipers, automatic weapons, car bombs, hostage situations\u2014he [is] sure [will] follow the attack,\u201d Keegan will write. He believes it is the responsibility of the New York Fire Department to deal with the fires in the Twin Towers, while the Police Department should be preparing for what might happen next. Many ESU members will come out of the towers after receiving the order to go tactical, according to Keegan.  <br/><u>Order Is Given after an Officer Hears of the Pentagon Attack</u> - However, according to author Anthea Appel, the order to go tactical is made by Sergeant Tom Sullivan, another ESU officer. Sullivan is currently at the corner of West and Vesey Streets along with Wasson, getting ready to take two teams into the WTC. At 9:56 a.m., after hearing over his radio about the attack on the Pentagon, which occurred at 9:37 a.m. .  <br/><u>Order Is Wrong but Saves Lives</u> - The order to go tactical will turn out to be mistaken as there are no attacks by armed terrorists on the first responders at the WTC. However, as a result of it being issued, numerous ESU members will be outside the Twin Towers instead of inside the buildings when the South Tower comes down and many of them will therefore avoid being killed in the collapse. While 14 ESU members will die in the WTC collapses, a far greater number will survive, Keegan will write, \u201cbecause Wasson\u2019s order pulled them out of the towers and saved their lives.\u201d  One ESU member, Detective Frank DeMasi, will conclude that Sullivan \u201cdefinitely saved his life when he made that last-minute decision to switch from rescue to tactical mode,\u201d according to Appel, since the delay while they changed into their combat gear \u201ckept DeMasi and his teammates from walking into the South Tower before it collapsed.\u201d  </p>", "image": "", "image_caption": "", "approved": true, "media_type": "html", "duration": 120, "start": 35760, "end": 35880, "vidid": "mfd9b2c7045710246ca079ee0021d191c"}, {"id": 16631, "start_date": "2001-09-11T09:56:00Z", "end_date": "2001-09-11T09:58:00Z", "calc_duration": 0, "sort": 0, "title": "Air Traffic Controller Changes Flight 93\u2019s Destination to Washington", "source": "History Commons", "full_title": "9:56 a.m. September 11, 2001: Air Traffic Controller Changes Flight 93\u2019s Destination to Washington - History Commons", "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a956newflightplan#a956newflightplan", "format": "html", "jump": 0, "trim": 0, "volume": "1.00", "mute": false, "content": "<p>An air traffic controller at the FAA\u2019s Cleveland Center enters a new flight plan for Flight 93 into the FAA computer system, giving a new destination of Reagan National Airport in Washington, DC.

The plan, Security Control of Air Traffic and Navigation Aids (SCATANA), was developed in the 1960s as a way to clear airspace above the US and off the US coast in the event of a confirmed warning of a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Once it is activated a wartime air traffic priority list is established, allowing essential aircraft and personnel to use the airspace. Among others, this list includes the US president, essential national security staff, aircraft involved in continental defense missions, and airborne command posts.  <br/><u>Eberhart Suggests Limited Version of Plan</u> - Eberhart and his staff suggest implementing the limited version of SCATANA over the air threat conference call. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta immediately concurs.  Unlike a full SCATANA, this modified version allows ground navigation aids to stay on, for the benefit of aircraft that are still airborne. Under the plan, for about the next three days all flights other than military, law enforcement, fire fighters, and medevac, will require approval from the national Defense Department/FAA Air Traffic Services Cell, located within the FAA\u2019s Herndon Command Center.  Notice is sent out to all civil and military air traffic control facilities, informing them that the skies now officially belong to NORAD.  <br/><u>Order Supposedly Made Late Due to Safety Concerns</u> - The SCATANA order is issued over an hour after the FAA ordered all planes down , and after at least three-quarters of them have already landed.  Eberhart will later say the delay is due to safety concerns, because NORAD would have been unable to control US airspace\u2014with over 4,000 planes airborne at the time of the attacks\u2014with its radar capabilities.  Defense Week magazine will suggest SCATANA is not implemented until even later, at around 2:00 p.m. It says NORAD issues a \u201cnotice to airmen\u201d implementing the modified version of SCATANA about five hours after Flight 11 hit the World Trade Center.  </p>", "image": "", "image_caption": "", "approved": true, "media_type": "html", "duration": 120, "start": 39600, "end": 39720, "vidid": "m6d36cf6be0854e401bb61ff0b80bcb0a"}, {"id": 16721, "start_date": "2001-09-11T11:00:00Z", "end_date": "2001-09-11T11:02:00Z", "calc_duration": 0, "sort": 0, "title": "Secretary of the Army White Is Unnecessarily Sent to a Secure Location outside Washington", "source": "History Commons", "full_title": "11:00 a.m. September 11, 2001: Secretary of the Army White Is Unnecessarily Sent to a Secure Location outside Washington - History Commons\r", "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1100whiteleaves#a1100whiteleaves", "format": "html", "jump": 0, "trim": 0, "volume": "1.00", "mute": false, "content": "<p>Secretary of the Army Thomas White is ordered to leave the Pentagon and go to Site R, an alternate military command center outside Washington, DC, but the decision to send him there will subsequently be found to have been a mistake and so he will return to the Pentagon later in the day.

Although Caine was his unit\u2019s supervisor of flying (SOF) this morning, he decided earlier on that he was going to get airborne, and so Lieutenant Colonel Phil Thompson has taken his place as SOF .  Missiles were loaded onto Caine and Rasmussen\u2019s F-16s while they were sitting in the cockpits.  Rasmussen will later recall that \u201cwe were probably 20 to 30 minutes behind\u201d the previous two jets to launch, \u201cbecause they were loading heat-seeking missiles on the aircraft.\u2026 Once they armed us up, we just rolled right down the runway and blasted off.\u201d The jets take off with hot guns and two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles each.

He will later recall that the caller sounds strange, and tell the 9/11 Commission that this is the \u201conly phone call that he\u2019d ever received of that nature in the 10 years he\u2019s been on the job for United.\u201d The maintenance officer presumes that the caller is the plane\u2019s pilot, because this specific type of satellite phone call can only be made from the flight deck of a commercial airliner. However, the caller\u2019s manner of talking is not professional. The number for the London facility would not have been programmed into the phone, so the caller would have needed to type it in. <br/><u>Caller Possibly Being Choked</u> - The maintenance officer subsequently contacts the United Airlines System Aircraft Maintenance Control (SAMC) at San Francisco International Airport to report the strange call. The FBI is already at the SAMC and is made aware of his report. It is informed that the maintenance officer has said the caller from the plane \u201csounded as if they were being choked.\u201d However, when he is interviewed by the 9/11 Commission in November 2003, the maintenance officer will state that \u201cit is difficult to say whether or not the pilot was getting choked.\u201d He will say he \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe this to be the case and doesn\u2019t recall reporting this,\u201d although he will indicate that it is \u201cpossible he previously told someone that it sounded like the person was being choked.\u201d <br/><u>Origin of Call Unknown</u> - The suspicious call comes up as \u201cregistration number unknown.\u201d However, the maintenance officer recognizes it as coming from what he will call a \u201cSat 7 phone,\u201d because, he will say, \u201cthe background noise was characteristic of that type of satellite call.\u201d Typically, Boeing 767s and 777s have the equipment to make \u201cSat 7\u201d calls, although the maintenance officer believes the call is most likely from a 777. The United Airlines legal department will subsequently tell the maintenance officer that \u201cit would be possible to find the station that placed the call, because United must have a record of the phone call.\u201d Satellite phone communication is expensive and each call is itemized when paid for. However, a 9/11 Commission memorandum in November 2003 will state that, at that time, the origin of the call \u201cis still unknown.\u201d <br/><u>Call Unrelated to Two United Airlines Hijackings</u> - According to the maintenance officer, the call is not tape recorded. But according to Richard Belme, a manager at the SAMC, the call is recorded but then only stored for a short time, maybe three months. The maintenance officer\u2019s notes from this day will subsequently be shredded. The 9/11 Commission will conclude that the suspicious call could not have come from either of the two hijacked United Airlines flights because it does not coincide with the timeframe of those flights. Furthermore, United Airlines Flight 93 was a Boeing 757 and so would not have been equipped with the type of phone necessary to make the call. In mid-2003, the aircraft maintenance officer will be told that \u201cthis issue [is] over.\u201d  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/Rich_Belme_2050081722-36623.jpg", "image_caption": "Richard Belme.

Earlier on, a Marine with VMFA-321 called Trey Murphy, a friend of his who works as a weapons controller at NEADS, to offer his unit\u2019s assistance. Minutes later, Murphy told a general from VMFA-321 who called NEADS, \u201c[W]e could use your airplanes\u201d .  <br/><u>Pilot Gives Incorrect Authentication Code</u> - Now Murphy tries to get the authentication code from one of the Marine pilots who has arrived over Washington, which will show that he is who he says he is, and that his orders are legal. However, the pilot responds with incorrect authentication, giving a code that has too many letters. Murphy again tries to authenticate him, but the pilot responds, \u201cDude, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to tell me.\u201d <br/><u>Weapons Controller Improvises Plan of Action</u> - Murphy quickly realizes what the problem is: The VMFA-321 fighters are not normally part of NORAD, and so do not have NORAD authenticators. Instead, their authenticators are from the Air Combat Command. Realizing this is a problem that will recur as more non-NORAD fighters get airborne, Murphy instructs his fellow weapons controller Michael Julian to help him call the squadron commanders of the non-NORAD jets that are taking off to patrol the Northeast US, so as to resolve the issue. Doing so is critically important because, as author Lynn Spencer will point out, \u201cThe authentication system is set up to ensure that a pilot knows he is being given a valid order, and a pilot cannot legally comply with an order unless he can authenticate it first.\u201d Murphy calls VMFA-321 at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, over a secured line and quickly improvises a plan of action. Soon after, faxes are sent off over secured lines to the squadrons that are launching aircraft, to make sure they all follow this plan. <br/><u>Murphy Checks in Marine Pilots</u> - The Marine pilots that have arrived over Washington have now devised their own plan for checking in with NEADS. Since Murphy is a former Marine, some of them know him and recognize his voice. They have therefore decided they will accept orders from him alone. After one of the pilots insists to another NEADS weapons controller that he will only take orders from Murphy, Murphy gets on the line and checks him in, saying: \u201cAll right!

But several choppers at the FBI facility in Quantico, just 30 miles south of the Pentagon, are reserved for specific duties during government emergencies and are currently locked down. And according to Creed and Newman, other government helicopters the bureau relies upon for backup are tied up, though what they are being used for is unstated.  Furthermore, NBC News has reported that the FBI\u2019s top teams have been away from Washington for the last two days for a major training exercise in California .

A technician there put the tape into a deck to be broadcast. However, the uplink failed twice. Finally, the third broadcast goes out to American TV screens. TV anchors emphasize that the president\u2019s remarks are recorded, not live. \u201cThe implication,\u201d journalist and author Bill Sammon will later write, \u201cwas that the White House had purposely delayed the airing of the tape in order to get a head start on the president\u2019s next secret destination.\u201d  The 9/11 Commission Report will similarly state that \u201cfor security reasons,\u201d Bush\u2019s statement \u201cwas taped and not broadcast live.\u201d  But according to Sammon: \u201c[T]he tape delay had been a function of mere logistics\u2014there were no cables available at Barksdale for a live feed on such short notice.

He spoke haltingly, mispronouncing several words as he looked down at his notes.\u201d  Howard Fineman of Newsweek will call the speech \u201cthe low point\u201d in the president\u2019s war on terrorism.  Bush will comment that the \u201csentiment\u201d of his speech \u201cwas right, but the setting\u2014a sterile conference room at a military base in Louisiana\u2014did not inspire much confidence.\u201d  </p>", "image": "", "image_caption": "", "approved": true, "media_type": "html", "duration": 120, "start": 42900, "end": 43020, "vidid": "m0baaf8eebc7de29c79163cc80da4e5f9"}, {"id": 16770, "start_date": "2001-09-11T11:55:00Z", "end_date": "2001-09-11T11:57:00Z", "calc_duration": 0, "sort": 0, "title": "Report of Airplane Approaching President Bush\u2019s Ranch Turns Out to Be False Alarm", "source": "History Commons", "full_title": "1:05 p.m. September 11, 2001: Report of Airplane Approaching President Bush\u2019s Ranch Turns Out to Be False Alarm - History Commons", "url": "http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a105ranchtargeted#a105ranchtargeted", "format": "html", "jump": 0, "trim": 0, "volume": "1.00", "mute": false, "content": "<p>While he is at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, President Bush receives an intelligence report from the US Strategic Command (Stratcom), informing him that a high-speed object is heading for his ranch in Crawford, Texas.

According to Clarke, Bush begins the meeting by saying, \u201cI\u2019m coming back to the White House as soon as the plane is fueled. No discussion.\u201d But according to Condoleezza Rice, he begins with the words, \u201cWe\u2019re at war.\u201d Clarke leads a quick review of what has already occurred, and issues that need to be quickly addressed. Bush asks CIA Director Tenet who he thinks is responsible for the day\u2019s attacks. Tenet later recalls, \u201cI told him the same thing I had told the vice president several hours earlier: al-Qaeda. The whole operation looked, smelled, and tasted like bin Laden.\u201d Tenet tells Bush that passenger manifests show that three known al-Qaeda operatives had been on Flight 77. According to Tenet, when he tells the president in particular about Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar (two of the alleged Flight 77 hijackers), Bush gives Mike Morell, his CIA briefer, \u201cone of those \u2018I thought I was supposed to be the first to know\u2019 looks.\u201d (Other evidence indicates the third al-Qaeda operative whose name is on the passenger manifest would be Salem Alhazmi  Tenet tells the meeting that al-Qaeda is \u201cthe only terrorist organization capable of such spectacular, well-coordinated attacks,\u201d and that \u201cIntelligence monitoring had overheard a number of known bin Laden operatives congratulating each other after the attacks. Information collected days earlier but only now being translated indicated that various known operatives around the world anticipated a big event. None specified the day, time, place or method of attack.\u201d Richard Clarke later corroborates that Tenet had at this time told the president he was certain that al-Qaeda was to blame. Yet only six weeks later, in an October 24, 2001 interview, Rice will claim differently. She will say, \u201cIn the first video conference, the assumption that everybody kind of shared was that it was global terrorists.\u2026 I don\u2019t believe anybody said this is likely al-Qaeda. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Tenet also relays a warning the CIA has received from French intelligence, saying another group of terrorists is within US borders and is preparing a second wave of attacks. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld briefs on the status of US forces, and states that about 120 fighters are now above US cities.

W. Bush ends up playing a round of golf with one of the course\u2019s employees. The employee, Charlie Cronk, recognizes the former first couple as they are walking by, and then goes and shakes hands with the former president. He asks George H. W. Bush if he will sign one of the course\u2019s scorecards. To his surprise, the former president says in response, \u201cI\u2019d be glad to if you can go out and play golf with me.\u201d He explains that he just needs \u201cto get his mind away from everything for a little bit.\u201d Cronk accepts the request and the two men therefore play nine holes together. Linda Stiloski, who owns the golf club, initially thinks Cronk is joking when he calls her shortly after 5:00 p.m. to tell her about their important visitors. All the same, she hurries to the golf course and, once there, sees Cronk and a Secret Service agent in a golf cart, with the former president and first lady walking behind them, accompanied by more Secret Service agents. <br/><u>Former President Is 'Very Friendly' with Everyone He Encounters</u> - George H. W. Bush makes the effort to interact with everyone he meets on the course. Cronk will later recall: \u201cHe would come up to you if you happen to be there. He\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, you want me to make that shot for you?\u2019 Or \u2018make that putt?\u2019 Or, \u2018How\u2019s things going today?\u2019 and all that.\u201d The former president is \u201cvery open with you\u201d and \u201cvery friendly,\u201d Cronk will comment.  Barbara Bush accompanies her husband for the first couple of holes he plays but is then unable to continue due to a recent back operation she had. She therefore sits on a bench as he finishes the game. \u201cIt all seemed so normal,\u201d she will write of her time at the golf course today.  <br/><u>Former President Signs Autographs before Leaving</u> - George H. W. Bush only mentions the day\u2019s terrorist attacks after he and Cronk have finished their game. He asks everyone at the course to say a prayer for the people who have lost their lives.  Before he leaves, he signs autographs and lets people take photos of him with the course\u2019s employees. The former first couple return to the Embassy Suites Hotel where they will spend the night. Shortly after 9:00 a.m. on September 12, they will be flown on a private jet from Milwaukee to Kennebunkport, Maine, where they have a summer home.  </p>", "image": "http://cdn.historycommons.org/images/events/Charlie_Cronk_2050081722-46694.jpg", "image_caption": "Charlie Cronk.

No one is killed.  It collapses in 6.6 seconds, which is just 0.6 of a second longer than it would have taken a free-falling object dropped from its roof to hit the ground.  Many questions will arise over the cause of its collapse in the coming months and years. Building 7, which was not hit by an airplane, is the first modern, steel-reinforced high-rise to collapse because of fire.  Some will later suggest that the diesel fuel stored in several tanks on the premises may have contributed to the building\u2019s collapse. The building contained a 6,000-gallon tank between its first and second floors and another four tanks, holding as much as 36,000 gallons, below ground level. There were also three smaller tanks on higher floors.  However, the cause of the collapse is uncertain. A 2002 government report will conclude: \u201cThe specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence.\u201d  Some reports indicate that the building may have been deliberately destroyed. Shortly after the collapse, CBS News anchor Dan Rather comments that the collapse is \u201creminiscent of\u2026 when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.\u201d  And moments after the collapse, MSNBC\u2019s Brian Williams joins David Restuccio, an FDNY lieutenant, by phone to ask him about the collapse. \u201cYou guys knew this was coming all day?\u201d asks Williams. Restuccio replies: \u201cWe had heard reports that the building was unstable, and that it would eventually need to come down on its own, or it would be taken down. I would imagine it came down on its own.\u201d Restuccio does not explain what he means by \u201cit would be taken down.\u201d  </p>", "image": "", "image_caption": "A four-image progression of photos showing World Trade Center Building 7 collapsing down into its footprint.
