Audience: teams building applications on Classicy — either apps that live inside a Classicy desktop, or host applications that consume Classicy as a library and register their own apps, HyperCard effects, or filesystem adapters.

What changed: Classicy now has an app manifest registry. One call, `registerApp(...)`, replaces the split registration surface (`registerAppEventHandler` + `registerClassicyUntrustedActionAllowlist`) and additionally declares — as runtime data — the actions your app handles and the shape of its internal state, both with written commentary. That metadata powers balloon help, HyperCard script discovery and argument validation, and dev-mode state validation in the kernel.

## 1. Do I have to change anything?

No. Both old APIs still work, unchanged:

- `registerAppEventHandler(prefix, handler)` — still the routing primitive; `registerApp` delegates to it.
- `registerClassicyUntrustedActionAllowlist(type)` — still the allowlist primitive, still floor-guarded.

Both are now marked `@deprecated`. An app registered the old way keeps working exactly as before — it just has no manifest, so balloon help, `listScriptableActions()`, and kernel validation see nothing for it.

Migrate when you want the metadata benefits, not because you must.

## 2. The one-call migration

Before:

```ts
import { registerAppEventHandler } from "classicy";

registerAppEventHandler("MyCompanyAppTV", myTvEventHandler);
```

After:

```ts
import { registerApp } from "classicy";
import { z } from "zod";

export const TvDataSchema = z.looseObject({
    channel: z.number().optional().describe("Currently tuned channel number."),
    muted: z.boolean().optional().describe("Whether audio is muted."),
});

export type TvData = z.infer<typeof TvDataSchema>;

registerApp({
    id: "TV.app",
    description: "Watch broadcast channels on the desktop.",
    prefix: "MyCompanyAppTV",
    handler: myTvEventHandler,
    actions: {
        MyCompanyAppTVTune: {
            description: "Tune the TV to a channel.",
            params: z.object({
                channel: z.number().describe("Channel number to tune to."),
            }),
        },
        MyCompanyAppTVMute: {
            description: "Toggle audio mute.",
        },
    },
    state: TvDataSchema,
});
```

Rules that matter:

- **`prefix` and `handler` travel together.** Passing one without the other registers no routing and logs a dev warning. Apps with no custom reducer can omit both and still declare actions/state.
- **`actions` and `state` are optional.** A `registerApp` call with only prefix/handler is a legal, metadata-free registration.
- **State schemas MUST be `z.looseObject`, never `z.object`.** The kernel writes keys your schema doesn't declare into `apps[id].data` (for example `openFiles` queues from the generic file-open route). looseObject passes unknown keys through validation and through `parseAppData` round-trips; a strict object would either reject valid stores or silently strip the kernel's keys.
- **Top-level state fields should be `.optional()`.** `apps[id].data` is legitimately `{}` or `undefined` before your app's first action; validation is for catching wrong shapes, not absence.
- **Put a `.describe()` on every field and a `description` on every action.** That text is the product: it is what balloon help and discovery surfaces display.

## 3. Apps that span multiple modules

Re-registering the same id merges additively (this is how HyperCard's player and editor share HyperCard.app):

- A new prefix+handler pair is appended; the same prefix twice is a no-op.
- Action types merge first-wins.
- The first state schema wins; a differing second one logs a dev warning. Convention: the module that owns the app's primary lifecycle registers the state schema (covering keys the other modules write), and secondary modules register only their prefix and actions.
- `description` is first-wins too, so let the primary module register first (import order in your entry component decides).

## 4. Exposing actions to HyperCard stacks

Before, exposing an action to stack scripts took a separate call:

```ts
registerClassicyUntrustedActionAllowlist("MyCompanyAppTVTune");
```

Now declare it on the manifest entry:

```ts
MyCompanyAppTVTune: {
    description: "Tune the TV to a channel.",
    params: z.object({ channel: z.number().describe("Channel to tune.") }),
    scriptable: true,
},
```

What `scriptable: true` does — and does not do:

- It adds the type to the untrusted-action allowlist (same mechanism as before). It can never cross the kernel's guarded-route floor: declaring `ClassicyDesktop*`, `ClassicyWindow*`, or the guarded exact types scriptable has no effect, and guarded types are excluded from the discovery index entirely.
- Stacks can discover it: `listScriptableActions()` returns `{ appId, type, description, params }` for every scriptable action.
- Script-authored args are validated against `params` before dispatch. A malformed effect is dropped with a dev warning naming the bad param — it never reaches your reducer. This is a behavior change to be aware of: if your schema is wrong, working stack effects will start being dropped in dev with a console warning telling you why.
- The dispatched payload is zod's parsed output. Plain `z.object` params strip keys the schema doesn't declare, and the kernel pins the action `type` and app record after the spread — a script cannot smuggle either. Declare every arg your reducer reads, or it won't arrive.

If you have hand-registered allowlist types with no manifest (custom HyperCard effects reviewed by your host), they keep working: no manifest entry means allowlist-check-only, exactly as before.

## 5. Retire your hand-rolled state guard

If you have an `isMyAppData(d)` type predicate, `parseAppData` replaces it using your schema as the single source of truth:

```ts
import { parseAppData } from "classicy";

// In your reducer:
const raw = ds.System.Manager.Applications.apps[appId].data ?? {};
const appData: TvData = parseAppData<TvData>(appId, raw) ?? { ...raw };
```

- Valid data comes back typed, with unknown keys preserved (looseObject passthrough).
- Invalid data returns `undefined`; choose your fallback deliberately — `?? { ...raw }` preserves current behavior of carrying the raw object forward, `?? {}` resets to a clean slate.
- Derive your data type from the schema (`z.infer`) so the two can never drift.

## 6. Balloon help from your own manifest

Your settings UI can now describe itself from live metadata instead of duplicated strings:

```tsx
import { ClassicyBalloonHelp, describeAppAction, describeAppState } from "classicy";

const muteBalloon = describeAppState("TV.app", "muted");

{muteBalloon ? (
    <ClassicyBalloonHelp title={muteBalloon.title} content={muteBalloon.content}>
        <ClassicyCheckbox ... />
    </ClassicyBalloonHelp>
) : (
    <ClassicyCheckbox ... />
)}
```

- `describeAppState(appId, "path.to.field")` — dot notation for nested fields; returns `{ title, content }` or `undefined` (unknown app/path, or no `.describe()` on the field). Render nothing when it's undefined.
- `describeAppAction(appId, type)` — same contract for actions.
- The returned `title` is the raw field name / action type. For end-user balloons you will usually want to supply your own title and use only the `content`.

## 7. What the kernel does with your state schema

In development builds only, after every dispatched action, the kernel validates the routed app's `data` against its registered schema:

- On mismatch it logs one `console.warn` naming the appId, the action type, and zod's issue list. It never rejects or rolls back state.
- A warning means your schema or handler is wrong — fix the schema to match reality (or the handler bug it exposed). Never "fix" it by mangling user state.
- Production builds skip validation entirely; apps without a state schema are never validated.

Practical tip: after migrating, run your app's flows once with the console open. A clean console means your schema matches your reducer's reality.

## 8. Migration checklist

- [ ] Replace `registerAppEventHandler(prefix, handler)` with one `registerApp({...})` per app id.
- [ ] Declare every action your reducer's switch handles, with a description; add `params` schemas matching exactly the fields each case reads.
- [ ] Declare state as `z.looseObject` with `.optional()` + `.describe()` on every top-level field; derive your data type via `z.infer`.
- [ ] Replace `registerClassicyUntrustedActionAllowlist(type)` with `scriptable: true` on the action entry (app-owned actions only).
- [ ] Replace `isMyAppData`-style guards with `parseAppData`.
- [ ] Exercise the app in dev and confirm no `[registerApp] App state failed its manifest schema` warnings.
- [ ] Optional: wire `describeAppAction`/`describeAppState` into your settings surfaces for balloon help.

## 9. API quick reference

All exported from the package root:

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `registerApp(def)` | The unified registration call. |
| `getAppManifest(appId)` / `listAppManifests()` | Raw manifest lookup. |
| `listScriptableActions()` / `getScriptableAction(type)` | HyperCard discovery surface (guarded routes excluded). |
| `describeAppAction(appId, type)` | Balloon-ready `{ title, content }` for an action. |
| `describeAppState(appId, fieldPath)` | Balloon-ready `{ title, content }` for a state field (dot paths). |
| `parseAppData<T>(appId, raw)` | Typed, validated read of `apps[id].data`; `undefined` on failure. |
| `validateAppStateForAction(ds, action)` | The kernel's dev-mode check (exposed for tests). |
| `registerAppEventHandler` / `registerClassicyUntrustedActionAllowlist` | Deprecated primitives — unchanged behavior, no manifest recorded. |
