Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way.\u201d  Pilots are trained to handle hijackings by staying calm, complying with any requests, and, if possible, dialing an emergency four-digit code on their plane\u2019s transponder. It only takes a few seconds to dial this code.  Yet, as the Boston Globe notes, \u201cIt appears that the hijackers\u2019 entry was surprising enough that the pilots did not have a chance to broadcast a traditional distress call\u201d .  The Los Angeles Times reports that, when flight attendant Amy Sweeney makes a phone call from the plane, she says the hijackers have \u201cjust gained access to the cockpit.\u201d  Yet her first attempted call is not until 8:22, and, according to official accounts, her first call that stays connected is at 8:25, well past when the 9/11 Commission says the hijacker takeover occurs.

Calls made to the number are routed to the first available phone station at one of several facilities, including the office in Cary.  <br/><u>Ong Tells Agent, 'We're Being Hijacked'</u> - The call is answered by Vanessa Minter, a reservation agent.

Gonzalez will join the call from Ong a short time later , and in it Ong will relay crucial information about what is happening on her plane.

Houck has, until now, had no direct contact with Flight 11 and the communication she receives from this other aircraft is the first indication she has of any problem on Flight 11.

Gonzalez is relaying to him information provided to her by Betty Ong, a flight attendant on Flight 11, about what is happening on the hijacked plane .  <br/><u>Marquis Describes Hijacking of Flight 11</u> - Marquis now talks to Mulcahy and describes what he knows about the crisis.  Mulcahy is the manager of SOC policies and procedures. His responsibilities include maintaining the emergency procedure checklist used in the SOC.  After telling him to \u201ccome here,\u201d Marquis says to Mulcahy: \u201cI got an incident going on here. Flight 11, from Boston to LA. The number three flight attendant [i.e. Ong] called and said that two male passengers [i.e. hijackers] on board stabbed the number one and the number five flight attendant.\u201d Marquis says the two hijackers have \u201cbroken into the cockpit and the plane is being flown erratically right now.\u201d He adds that the hijackers \u201cwere in seats 2A and 2B.\u201d Apparently still talking to Mulcahy, Marquis gives the instruction, \u201cAll the information on Flight 11, bring it to me here.\u201d He then repeats what he knows about the incident, saying: \u201cThe passengers in 2A and 2B, two male passengers, have broken into the cockpit, stabbed the number one flight attendant. Okay, so right now the plane is being flown erratically, but that\u2019s all we know.\u201d <br/><u>Marquis Tells Colleague to Keep Quiet about Hijacking</u> - Marquis then says he wants the news of the incident kept quiet. He says: \u201cI don\u2019t want this spread all over this office right now. Any information that you get, send to me, okay?\u201d  A tape recording of today\u2019s events in the SOC, including this conversation, will in 2004 be played to some relatives of victims of the 9/11 attacks. One relative, who is a veteran flight attendant for United Airlines, will, after hearing the tape, be highly critical of the apparent desire of American Airlines managers to keep the news of the hijacking among themselves. She will say: \u201cIt was disgusting. The very first response was cover-up, when they should have been broadcasting this information all over the place.\u201d Another relative will say, \u201cI find it alarming that the airline\u2026 would want to hold something as horrific as a hijacking among a few people, when bells and whistles should have been going off in all categories of responsibility.\u201d  </p>",

The big-budget five-hour miniseries, called <i>Terror</i>, will combine the casts of all three of NBC\u2019s <i>Law &amp; Order</i> crime drama series: the original show, <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>, and <i>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</i>. It is intended to be broadcast in May 2002. Its storyline follows a devotee of Osama bin Laden who goes from an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan to New York. There, he sets off explosives in the subway under Times Square, killing over 1,000 people. A bioterrorist release of anthrax is subsequently discovered.  <br/><u>Group Doing Planning Work for Show</u> - This morning, Neal Baer, one of <i>Law &amp; Order\u2019s</i> executive producers, is in New York with some of his colleagues, doing preproduction planning for <i>Terror</i>. The group is at a facility at Chelsea Piers, on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, only a couple of miles from the WTC.

The Congressional picnic is a bipartisan event held on the South Lawn of the White House, which brings together members of Congress, their families, and members of the administration for a casual and lighthearted evening.  An estimated 1,500 to 1,800 people are expected to attend today\u2019s event, which is scheduled to begin at about 7 o\u2019clock this evening.  A caterer from Texas has been helping to prepare the food and a band has been booked to provide music.  About 16 White House chefs are busy getting ready for the event.  Meanwhile, members of the Army are at the southeast gate, delivering mobile kitchens for it.  About 170 to 180 picnic tables have already been set up on the South Lawn, along with a stage.  However, the event will be canceled in response to this morning\u2019s attacks.  Much of the food prepared for it will be given to members of the Secret Service, Washington, DC, police, and National Guard who respond to the crisis, and to staffers who stay behind after the White House is evacuated.  Some people will later point out how much death and destruction could have resulted if the Congressional picnic had been a target of today\u2019s attacks. (White House press secretary Ari Fleischer publicly announced, four days ago, that the picnic would be taking place on the South Lawn this evening, so terrorists could presumably have learned when they needed to carry out an attack if they wanted to target the event.  ) \u201cHad [the attacks] occurred at night and had the White House been a target, [the terrorists] would\u2019ve been able to wipe out the entire United States government,\u201d Gary Walters, the chief White House usher, will comment.  \u201cIf the terrorists knew the entire government was going to be on the South Lawn at 5:30 at night, they could have killed everybody,\u201d Representative Rob Andrews (D-NJ) will say.  </p>",

        "content": "<p>As the 9/11 attacks are taking place, a large military training exercise called Global Guardian is said to be \u201cin full swing.\u201d It has been going on since the previous week.  Global Guardian is an annual exercise sponsored by US Strategic Command (Stratcom) in cooperation with US Space Command and NORAD. One military author defines Stratcom as \u201cthe single US military command responsible for the day-to-day readiness of America\u2019s nuclear forces.\u201d  <br/><u>Exercise Tests Military's Ability to Fight a Nuclear War</u> - Global Guardian is a global readiness exercise involving all Stratcom forces and aims to test Stratcom\u2019s ability to fight a nuclear war. It is one of many \u201cpractice Armageddons\u201d that the US military routinely stages.  It links with a number of other military exercises, including Crown Vigilance (an Air Combat Command exercise), Apollo Guardian (a US Space Command exercise), and the NORAD exercises Vigilant Guardian and Amalgam Warrior.  Global Guardian is both a command post and a field training exercise, and is based around a fictitious scenario designed to test the ability of Stratcom and its component forces to deter a military attack against the US. Hundreds of military personnel are involved.  The exercise involves \u201ca lot of the elements of what ultimately would be the nuclear command and control system in support of a national emergency,\u201d according to Admiral Richard Mies, the commander in chief of Stratcom. It includes an \u201cexercise secretary of defense\u201d and \u201can exercise president.\u201d Mies will say that because of the exercise, \u201cA lot of [Stratcom\u2019s] command and control systems that, in peacetime, are normally not on alert were at a much, much higher state of alert [on September 11] and we had a number of aircraft, manned control aircraft that were airborne that were simulating their wartime roles.\u201d  <br/><u>Exercise Normally Held in October or November</u> - According to a 1998 Internet article by the British American Security Information Council\u2014an independent research organization\u2014Global Guardian is held in October or November each year.  In his book <i>Code Names</i>, NBC News military analyst William Arkin dates this exercise for October 22-31, 2001.  And a military newspaper reported in March 2001 that Global Guardian was scheduled for October 2001.  If this is correct, then some time after March, the exercise must have been rescheduled for early September. <br/><u>Exercise Includes a 'Computer Network Attack'</u> - Furthermore, a 1998 Defense Department newsletter reported that for several years Stratcom had been incorporating a computer network attack (CNA) into Global Guardian. The attack involved Stratcom \u201cred team\u201d members and other organizations acting as enemy agents, and included attempts to penetrate the command using the Internet and a \u201cbad\u201d insider who had access to a key command and control system. The attackers \u201cwar dialed\u201d the phones to tie them up and sent faxes to numerous fax machines throughout the Command. They also claimed they were able to shut down Stratcom\u2019s systems. Reportedly, Stratcom planned to increase the level of computer network attack in future Global Guardian exercises.  It is unclear if a computer network attack is incorporated into Global Guardian in 2001. </p>",

Bueno says, \u201cI have a situation with American 11, a possible hijack.\u201d He adds that Flight 11 \u201cdeparted Boston, going to LAX [Los Angeles International Airport]. Right now he\u2019s south of Albany.\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019d like to scramble some fighters to go tail him.\u201d Spence replies that he will contact Otis Air Base about the situation, and tells Bueno, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to these guys over here and see what we can do.\u201d Bueno then adds that Flight 11 is currently airborne, is about 40 miles south of Albany, and is visible only on primary radar.  Bueno also calls the air traffic control tower at Otis Air Base around this time, to alert it to Flight 11 and request military assistance .  <br/><u>Bueno Supposedly Violating Protocol</u> - Bueno will say he decided to call the Cape TRACON based on his memory of a previous aircraft hijacking.  But according to the 9/11 Commission Report, by trying to get military assistance through the TRACON, the \u201cBoston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed chain of command.\u201d  Indeed, Bueno will tell the 9/11 Commission that he knows his call should instead be to NEADS, \u201cbut due to the urgency of the circumstance [he] called directly to the FAA contact point for Otis.\u201d  And Spence will tell the Commission that arranging for fighters to be scrambled in response to a hijacking \u201cis not the typical responsibility of an operations supervisor with the FAA,\u201d like himself. He will also say that it is \u201cunusual for the [air traffic control] centers to contact TRACON for information.

Halleck contacted the FAA\u2019s Boston Center at 8:29 a.m. to inquire about Flight 11 . That information, according to the 9/11 Commission, led American Airlines to suspect that Flight 11 had been hijacked.  Marquis now instructs Halleck, \u201cTell [air traffic control] to handle this as an emergency.\u201d According to a 9/11 Commission memorandum, \u201cAt this point, Marquis was just confirming it was a hijack and he wanted to make sure Halleck was communicating the emergency to the [air traffic control] system.\u201d Halleck answers that FAA controllers are treating Flight 11 as a hijacking, saying, \u201cThey have in there, it\u2019s been hijacked.\u201d Marquis replies: \u201cIt is.

He is talking to his supervisor in an office in the B-1 level in the basement when, he says, \u201cI heard this massive explosion below, on level B-2 or 3.\u201d He says, \u201cThe floor vibrated. We were all thrown upwards, then everyone in the office started screaming.\u201d Then, \u201cseconds later, there was another explosion way above, which made the building sway from side to side. And this, we later discovered, was the first plane hitting the North Tower on the 90th floor.\u201d A man then runs into the office, shouting, \u201cExplosion! Explosion!\u201d The man, Felipe David, had been standing in front of a nearby lift when a fireball had burst from the lift shaft, severely burning him. Rodriguez will later question, \u201cNow you tell me how an explosion from a jet liner could have burnt a man 90 floors down within seconds of impact?\u201d The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will suggest that the basement explosion Rodriguez heard might have been caused by a fireball traveling from the aircraft down the central lift shaft. However, some time after hearing it, Rodriguez rescues two people trapped in a lift. He will therefore doubt NIST\u2019s claim, saying that if it were true, \u201cWhy were the two people [I] rescued from the lift not burnt to death?\u201d  Rodriguez also claims to have witnessed alleged hijacker Mohand Alshehri in the World Trade Center in June 2001 . </p>",

The NCS is a relatively small government agency that works to ensure the availability of critical communications networks during times of crisis.  <br/><u>Center Conducts Non-Stop Operations</u> - An NCS publication will later describe, \u201cImmediately,\u201d in response to the attacks, \u201cthe NCC began non-stop operations to support NS/EP [national security and emergency preparedness] communications between federal, state, and local responders, to restore damaged communications lines in Arlington, Virginia, and New York City, and to provision new lines for the recovery and investigation activities.\u201d The NCC operates at four sites: the NCC itself, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Defense Department\u2019s Global Network Operations Support Center headquarters, and a remote \u201ccontinuity of operations\u201d location. Brenton Greene, the director of the NCS, goes to his \u201cContinuity of Government\u201d site, where personnel operate around the clock to monitor the status of the telecommunications network, and coordinate priorities and repairs. The NCS, which is part of the Department of Defense, also deploys military reservists to three FEMA regional operations centers. <br/><u>Time Center Activated at Unclear</u> - Greene will tell the 9/11 Commission that the NCC is activated at 8:48 a.m.  However, other accounts will indicate that the center is not activated until later on. According to journalist and author Dan Verton, Greene\u2014who is attending a briefing on the terrorist threat to the US\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure, apparently at the NCC\u2014initially believes the first plane hit the World Trade Center by accident, and therefore orders the briefing to continue . It is only when the second plane hits the WTC at 9:03 a.m. that he realizes \u201cthere was some threat,\u201d and responds to the crisis.  Counterterrorism \u201ctsar\u201d Richard Clarke will write that he himself gives the instruction to activate the NCS, at around 12:30 p.m. Then, according to Clarke, his colleague Paul Kurtz calls Greene and instructs him to tell all the major telephone companies that \u201cthey need to support Verizon.\u201d  <br/><u>Center Coordinates Emergency Communications during Crises</u> - The NCS was established by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, in order to provide better communications support to critical government functions during emergencies. An executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 broadened the NCS\u2019s capabilities, and listed its duties as \u201cthe planning for and provision of national security and emergency preparedness communications for the federal government under all circumstances, including crisis or emergency, attack, recovery, and reconstitution.\u201d  The NCS consists of 22 federal agencies, 100 full-time civilian employees, and 10 military employees.  The mission of the NCC is to assist \u201cin the initiation, coordination, restoration, and reconstitution of national security or emergency preparedness telecommunications services or facilities under all conditions of crisis or emergency.\u201d The center is composed of members from the US government and the telecommunications industry.  There are 150 private sector contractors from 21 companies working at the NCC.  </p>",

There might have been a malfunction or something on the aircraft that had taken place, but we really didn\u2019t have any indications of what was going on yet.\u201d  <br/><u>CMOC Personnel Unaware that Crash Was Deliberate</u> - The CMOC is \u201cthe nerve centre of North America\u2019s air defense,\u201d according to the BBC.  Its role, according to the Toronto Star, is \u201cto fuse every critical piece of information NORAD has into a concise and crystalline snapshot.\u201d  But it is only after personnel there see the television coverage of the second plane hitting the WTC at 9:03 a.m. that they realize \u201cwe had something much more sinister than just an accident, a really coordinated and deliberate action,\u201d according to Findley.  Armstrong will recall: \u201c[W]hen we saw the video [of the second crash], we said: \u2018Wait a second. Those are commercial-size airplanes. Those aren\u2019t general aviation aircraft.\u2019 That obviously changed the situation significantly.\u201d  According to Glover, after the second crash, \u201cWe knew then that the first one was not a mistake and we knew that this was intentional.\u201d  </p>",

Hayes is a retired New York City firefighter who now works for OCS Security, which holds the fire safety contract for the WTC. He is on duty at the fire command desk in the ground-floor lobby of the South Tower.  <br/><u>Hayes Told about 'Major Explosion' at the WTC</u> - Hayes, who currently has no information about what has happened or guidance that he can provide to tenants of the South Tower, phones Thompson, the deputy fire safety director at the fire command desk in the North Tower. After Hayes introduces himself, Thompson tells him: \u201cWe got, uh, a major explosion over at the Trade Center here. It might be an aircraft.\u201d Hayes then says: \u201cWe just wanted to get some direction on evacuation.

However, shortly after Hayes calls Thompson, an announcement, later believed to have been made by Hayes, will go out over the public address system in the South Tower, telling workers that their building is safe and instructing them to stay in, or return to, their offices .  <br/><u>Deputy Fire Safety Directors Have Numerous Responsibilities</u> - The deputy fire safety directors who work in the main lobby of each of the Twin Towers have responsibilities that include eliminating potential fire safety hazards, being available to address any concerns tenants might have relating to fire safety, and assisting with crowd control and evacuation, if required.  Equipment on their consoles allows them to monitor elevators and adjust ventilation systems, and they can press a button in order to deliver announcements over the public address system in their buildings.  </p>",

After the center\u2019s manager informs them that a plane has crashed into the WTC, personnel at the system engineer\u2019s desk turn on CNN and see the footage of the burning North Tower. Scoggins hears yelling from the desk and walks over to see what is going on. He sees the news reports, which currently state that just a small aircraft hit the tower. As author Lynn Spencer will describe: \u201cHis initial thought is that some controller must have really screwed up. Yet the more he thinks about it, the less that makes sense. It\u2019s a clear day with unlimited visibility, and planes don\u2019t just fly into buildings.\u201d Along with supervisor Daniel Bueno, Scoggins starts contacting other facilities, trying to find out more about what is going on. Several of these facilities are picking up an aircraft\u2019s emergency locator transmitter\u2014a device which begins transmitting a signal when a plane crashes. But Boston Center lacks the necessary equipment to pinpoint where the signal is coming from. Looking again at the TV footage showing the WTC, Scoggins wonders if Flight 11 crashed into the tower.

The attendant reports that Flight 175 has been hijacked, both of its pilots have been killed, a flight attendant has been stabbed, and the hijackers are probably flying the plane. The line then goes dead.  The call, which lasts 75 seconds, is made using an Airfone in row 31 at the back of the plane. Flight crews on United aircraft are able to contact the maintenance office simply by dialing *349 on an Airfone.  The identity of the attendant making the call is unclear. According to the Wall Street Journal, the caller is \u201ca female flight attendant.\u201d  The 9/11 Commission Report, however, refers to them as \u201ca male flight attendant,\u201d and one of the Commission\u2019s earlier staff statements will specifically name Robert Fangman, who is one of the attendants on Flight 175.  A summary of the phone calls made from the four hijacked planes presented at the 2006 Zacarias Moussaoui trial will refer to the caller simply as a \u201cflight attendant,\u201d with a question mark signifying their name.  After the call ends, Policastro and also another employee at the maintenance office try contacting Flight 175 using ACARS (an e-mail system that enables personnel on the ground to rapidly communicate with those in the cockpit of an aircraft), but they receive no response to these and subsequent attempts at reaching the flight. According to GTE Airfone records, another successful call will be made from Flight 175 to the maintenance office four minutes after this first one . The supervisor also calls the airline\u2019s security chief.  </p>",

        "content": "<p>Just one or two minutes before it crashes into the World Trade Center, Flight 175 narrowly avoids a mid-air collision with another commercial aircraft.  Midwest Airlines Flight 7 (Midex 7) is a DC-9 jet bound from Milwaukee to New York\u2019s La Guardia Airport, with about 30 passengers and five crew members on board.  Pilot Gerald Earwood and co-pilot Eric Fjelstad have been concerned at the unusually slow radio responses they have been receiving from New York air traffic controllers.  As they are approaching La Guardia from the southwest, Earwood is again frustrated as he awaits the controller\u2019s response to his latest transmission.  <br/><u>Instructed to Turn Left</u> - Suddenly, the voice of a panicked controller comes over the radio: \u201cMidex 7, are you with me? <i>Midex 7, Midex 7, are you with me?</i>\u201d Unknown to Earwood, controllers have noticed that Flight 175 is now flying directly at his plane at over 500 miles per hour. Earwood replies, \u201cMidex 7 is with you out of 7 for 4,000,\u201d meaning he has just passed through 7,000 feet in his descent to his assigned altitude of 4,000 feet. The controller orders: \u201cRoger, Midex 7, turn left now! Head two-four-zero degrees now, as quick as you can!\u201d The pilots of Midex 7 begin a standard 30-degrees-of-bank turn. But even though they are doing exactly what they have been ordered to, the controller continues, \u201cLeft turn, Midex, <i>left turn!</i>\u201d Several seconds later, the controller restates his order: \u201cMidex 7, tighten it up! <i>Roll left! Now! Now! Now!</i>\u201d Earwood looks out of the window for the plane he is meant to be avoiding, but cannot see anything. <br/><u>Narrowly Avoids Collision</u> - As Midex 7 is completing its left turn, the controller comes back over the radio even more panicked than before, ordering: \u201d<i>Roll right, Midex! Roll right as hard as you can!</i> Keep it tight, Midex. Roll hard right! <i>Now! Now!</i>\u201d Midex 7 complies with the instruction, but Earwood is wondering where the plane is that he is trying to avoid. At the FAA\u2019s New York Center, air traffic controllers watch as the radar returns for Flight 175 and Midex 7 get so close that they appear to merge on the screens. Finally, Flight 175 continues its rapid descent toward New York, after having narrowly avoided a collision.  Midex 7 returns to its approach to La Guardia Airport, and then Earwood overhears a radio transmission from another pilot, who reports that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center. Earwood will later estimate that Flight 175 crashes into the South Tower 60 to 90 seconds after its near-collision with Midex 7. He sees the fireball coming from the tower, but does not immediately connect it with the aircraft he has just avoided.  Minutes earlier, Flight 175 almost collided with at least two other planes as it descended toward Manhattan .  The incident with Midex 7 will not come to light until 2008, when it is described in the book <i>Touching History: The Untold Story of the Drama that Unfolded in the Skies Over America on 9/11</i>, by Lynn Spencer.  </p>",

Stephen Roebuck, who is working at the Hampton Sector radar position, now communicates with them.  The Hampton Sector covers the area that includes the Whiskey 105 airspace. <br/><u>Pilots Unable to Give Specific Information about 'Hold'</u> - Roebuck asks the pilots of the fighters if they know their destination. They reply no, and say they need to hold in the western area of Whiskey 105. Roebuck wants information on the position they will hold at in Whiskey 105, but the pilots say they cannot give a specific location. Instead, they tell Roebuck to keep them in a \u201cpublished hold\u201d in the area. Roebuck asks if the fighters want a \u201cradial\u201d or a \u201clatitude/longitude\u201d hold, but is told they will maintain themselves. <br/><u>Controller Finds Fighters' Unspecific 'Hold' Unusual</u> - Due to the lack of information the pilots have provided him with, Roebuck is unsure what the fighters are going to do, and does not know how to clear airspace for their potential course. Roebuck will tell the 9/11 Commission that \u201cnormally, clearing area for fighters is very specific, so this unknown generic hold [is] extremely unusual.

The declaration pushes all their aircraft onto neighboring sectors, and any new airplanes from adjacent sectors are turned back, at the sector boundaries if necessary.\u201d  The decision to declare ATC zero is made after the second plane hits the World Trade Center, confirming that the US is under terrorist attack. There are currently hundreds of aircraft in the skies around New York and the western Atlantic that the New York Center is responsible for.  Bruce Barrett, a senior manager at the New York Center, announces, \u201cWe\u2019re declaring ATC zero,\u201d and Mike McCormick, the center\u2019s air traffic control manager, approves the order. Several of the managers there then start informing air traffic controllers of the decision. <br/><u>Unprecedented Order</u> - USA Today will report that this decision is unprecedented: \u201cControllers had gone to \u2018air traffic control zero\u2019 before, but only when their radar shut down or their radio transmitters went silent. The planes kept flying then, and controllers in other centers guided them. This time, ATC zero means something far more drastic. It means emptying the skies\u2014something that has never been attempted. And not just the skies over Manhattan. Controllers must clear the air from southern New England to Maryland, from Long Island to central Pennsylvania\u2014every mile of the region they control.\u2026 Controllers from Cleveland to Corpus Christi must reroute jets headed to the region and put some in holding patterns.\u201d <br/><u>Accounts Conflict over Whether Center Seeks Permission</u> - According to USA Today, McCormick and Barrett declare ATC zero without first seeking permission from higher-ups, because a \u201ccall to Washington could take minutes, and they aren\u2019t sure they have that long.\u201d  But according to Lynn Spencer, a New York Center supervisor has already requested ATC zero in a call to the FAA\u2019s Herndon Command Center. Ben Sliney, the Command Center\u2019s national operations manager, assured the supervisor, \u201cYou take care of matters in your center and we will provide all the assistance necessary by stopping any further aircraft from entering your airspace.\u201d  </p>",

According to Von Essen, Downey\u2014who is a highly respected expert on building collapses\u2014says to him, \u201cYou know, these buildings can collapse.\u201d Von Essen later recalls, \u201cHe just said it in passing, not that these buildings will collapse in 40 minutes and we have to get everybody out of here, or not that they\u2019ll collapse by tomorrow, or not that they necessarily will collapse at all. Just that they <i>can</i> collapse.\u201d  But other firefighters do not appear to have shared this concern. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Fire Department command officers who are planning for operations inside the Twin Towers expect that there will \u201cbe localized collapse conditions on the damaged fire floors,\u201d but do \u201cnot expect that there [will] be any massive collapse conditions or complete building collapse.\u201d At the end of its three-year investigation of the WTC collapses, NIST will report, \u201cNo one interviewed indicated that they thought that the buildings would completely collapse.\u201d  In fact, Deputy Fire Commissioner Lynn Tierney will meet up with Downey and others\u2014including Von Essen\u2014slightly later, on the south lawn of the WTC complex, where a new command center is set up. At that time, according to Tierney, Downey will only be concerned that the 360-foot antenna atop the North Tower will fall, and \u201cNo one ever thought the towers were going to come down.\u201d  However, shortly before the first tower comes down, EMT Richard Zarrillo will be asked to relay a message to some senior firefighters that the mayor\u2019s Office of Emergency Management \u201csays the buildings are going to collapse\u201d . The 9/11 Commission will state, \u201cThe best estimate of one senior [fire] chief, provided to the chief of the department sometime between 9:25 and 9:45, was that there might be a danger of collapse [of the South Tower] in a few hours, and therefore units probably should not ascend above floors in the sixties.\u201d The Commission does not state, however, whether this fire chief was referring to a total building collapse or just a localized collapse.  Ray Downey is killed when the second tower collapses at 10:28 a.m.  </p>",

Following the second attack on the World Trade Center, Terry Biggio, the operations manager at the Boston Center, is concerned that there may be additional attacks. He therefore asks a manager at the FAA\u2019s New England regional office if warnings could be sent to airborne aircraft via \u201cACARS or something,\u201d advising them to increase their cockpit security.  (ACARS is an e-mail system that allows personnel on the ground to rapidly communicate with those in the cockpit of an aircraft.  ) Biggio is particularly concerned about the need to warn airborne international flights that are scheduled to arrive at New York\u2019s JFK International Airport. On the advice of a New England Region representative, Boston Center decides to contact Air Transport Association representatives through the FAA\u2019s Herndon Command Center and ask them to formally request that airlines warn their aircraft to heighten cockpit security. According to the 9/11 Commission, though, Biggio is \u201c[n]ot content to rely on the airlines to warn their aircraft,\u201d and so decides that the Boston Center will issue a Notice to Airmen (\u201cNOTAM\u201d) to heighten cockpit security in light of the attacks in New York.  The NOTAM system is the communication method used to define the rules of the day for air traffic controllers and pilots. With the status of equipment, airports, and rules changing frequently, the NOTAM system is used to distribute any changes to all pilots and controllers.  Two or three minutes later, controllers at the Boston Center will contact all the aircraft in their airspace by radio and advise them to increase cockpit security .  </p>",

        "content": "<p>A passenger on Flight 77, Barbara Olson, calls her husband, Theodore (Ted) Olson, who is solicitor general at the Justice Department.  Ted Olson is in his Justice Department office watching news of the attacks on the World Trade Center on television when his wife calls. A few days later, he will recall: \u201cShe told me that she had been herded to the back of the plane. She mentioned that they had used knives and box cutters to hijack the plane. She mentioned that the pilot had announced that the plane had been hijacked.\u201d  He tells her that two planes have hit the WTC.  Barbara Olson says she feels nobody is taking charge.  Ted Olson doesn\u2019t know if she is near the pilots, but at one point she asks: \u201cWhat shall I tell the pilot? What can I tell the pilot to do?\u201d  Then the call is cut off without warning.  <br/><u>Ted Olson's Recollections Vague</u> - Ted Olson\u2019s recollection of the call\u2019s timing will be extremely vague. He will say the call \u201cmust have been 9:15 [a.m.] or 9:30 [a.m.]. Someone would have to reconstruct the time for me.\u201d  Other accounts place the call around 9:25 a.m.  The call is said to last about a minute.  By some accounts, Ted Olson\u2019s message to his wife, that planes have hit the WTC, comes later, in a second phone call.  According to one account, Barbara Olson calls her husband from inside a bathroom.  But in another, she is near a pilot, and in yet another she is near two pilots.  <br/><u>Conflicting Accounts of Type of Phone Used</u> - Ted Olson\u2019s accounts of how his wife makes her calls are also conflicting. Three days after 9/11, he will say: \u201cI found out later that she was having, for some reason, to call collect and was having trouble getting through. You know how it is to get through to a government institution when you\u2019re calling collect.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t know what kind of phone she uses, but he has \u201cassumed that it must have been on the airplane phone, and that she somehow didn\u2019t have access to her credit cards. Otherwise, she would have used her cell phone and called me.\u201d  Why Barbara Olson would have needed access to her credit cards to call him on her cell phone is not explained. However, in another interview on the same day, Ted Olson will say his wife uses a cell phone and her call may be cut off \u201cbecause the signals from cell phones coming from airplanes don\u2019t work that well.\u201d  Six months later, he will claim she calls collect, \u201cusing the phone in the passengers\u2019 seats.\u201d  However, it is not possible to call on seatback phones, collect or otherwise, without a credit card, which would render making a collect call moot. Many other details in Ted Olson\u2019s accounts are conflicting, and he will fault his memory and say he \u201ctends to mix the two [calls from his wife] up because of the emotion of the events.\u201d  <br/><u>Call Supposedly Made through Secretary</u> - According to official reports, Barbara Olson is able to reach her husband through a secretary, Lori Lynn Keyton, twice, at around 9:15 a.m. The first call is collect and comes through a live operator, while the second is direct.  </p>",

He calls Mark Randol, the manager of the FAA\u2019s Washington, DC, Civil Aviation Security Field Office, who is based at Washington Dulles International Airport. As Randol will later recall, Arroyo makes it clear to him that this is a terrorist attack and reports several hijackings. These hijackings include Flight 175 (the second plane to hit the WTC) and Flight 77 (which will hit the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m.). Arroyo also reports, erroneously, that another plane, United Airlines Flight 177, has been hijacked. Randol immediately instructs his staff members to find out all they can about these flights. By 9:45 a.m., they will have identified that Flight 77 had taken off from Dulles Airport, but are unable to confirm whether it has been hijacked. They also discover that United Airlines Flight 177 is in fact still on the ground at Logan Airport, being held at the gate there.  The reason for Arroyo\u2019s incorrect report of this plane being hijacked is unknown. </p>",

One firefighter tells a colleague over radio, \u201cThat plane is ours, I repeat, it is ours.\u201d Rescue operations therefore continue.  The source of the incorrect report is apparently Richard Rotanz, the deputy director of the New York Office of Emergency Management (OEM), who is reportedly  in the OEM command center on the 23rd floor of WTC Building 7. A Secret Service agent in WTC 7 reportedly told him there were unconfirmed reports of other planes in the air. When OEM Director Richard Sheirer called Rotanz some time after the second WTC tower was hit, Rotanz relayed this information, telling him there were \u201cstill planes unaccounted for that may [be] heading for New York.\u201d Sheirer then told people in the North Tower lobby \u201cthat another plane was on the way.\u201d Journalists Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins, in their book <i>Grand Illusion</i>,  blame Sheirer for \u201cinstantly converting unspecific information into a very specific false alarm.\u201d This false alarm quickly ends up on fire and police department dispatches. Sheirer is apparently so unnerved by it that he instructs the police department aviation unit to not let another plane hit the WTC. As he will later tell the 9/11 Commission, though, \u201cWe were grasping at straws,\u201d since no police helicopter could \u201cstop a commercial jet going over 400 miles per hour.\u201d  Emergency medical technician Richard Zarrillo is currently in WTC 7, and is informed by an OEM rep there of the alleged third plane inbound for New York.

It\u2019s a suicide mission.\u201d Deena hears him repeating the information she has told him to other people. When she asks who this is, he tells her he is talking to his seatmate.  Tom wants to know if commercial aircraft have been hijacked, how many planes and which airlines are involved, and who is involved?  He then says: \u201cWe\u2019re turning back toward New York. We\u2019re going back to the World Trade Center. No, wait, we\u2019re turning back the other way. We\u2019re going south.\u201d He reports: \u201cWe\u2019re over a rural area. It\u2019s just fields. I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d He then hangs up. The call has lasted about two minutes.  According to Longman, unlike his previous call, which he made using his cell phone, Tom Burnett makes this call using an Airfone.  But other reports will state that he makes all four of his calls from Flight 93 using his cell phone.  According to notes of Deena Burnett\u2019s later interview with the FBI, all Tom\u2019s calls are made using his cell phone, but \u201cone of the calls did not show on the caller identification as [Deena] was on the line with another call\u201d when it was made. This could be referring to this second call, which occurred while Deena was on the phone with the FBI agent.  </p>",

When later interviewed by Navy historian John Darrell Sherwood about his experiences of the 9/11 attacks, Parsons will recall: \u201cI was looking out my window. I have a perfect view of Reagan National Airport. An American Airlines plane had just taken off, I mean, not 30 seconds before this plane [Flight 77] hit the Pentagon.\u201d Parsons will add that the American Airlines plane is \u201ctaking off to the north, to the, different than the normal way. In other words, they were taking off toward the Pentagon.\u201d  Reagan National Airport is less than a mile from the Pentagon.  Parsons will continue, \u201cWell, this American Airlines plane had just taken off, I mean it couldn\u2019t have been a minute, 30 seconds before this plane [Flight 77] hit the Pentagon.\u201d  Flight 77 hits the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m. .  Parsons will ask Sherwood if anyone has interviewed the pilot of the American Airlines plane he saw taking off, since that pilot must have witnessed the attack on the Pentagon. Sherwood will answer no, but add, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s another good lead for either myself or one of the other people to follow up on.\u201d Whether the pilot is ever identified or interviewed is unknown.  </p>",

Remarkably, this C-130 is the same C-130 that will be 17 miles from Flight 93 when it later crashes into the Pennsylvania countryside .  The pilot, Lt. Col. Steve O\u2019Brien, will claim that he took off around 9:30 a.m., planning to return to Minnesota after dropping supplies off in the Caribbean. He will describe his close encounter: \u201cWhen air traffic control asked me if we had him [Flight 77] in sight, I told him that was an understatement\u2014by then, he had pretty much filled our windscreen. Then he made a pretty aggressive turn so he was moving right in front of us, a mile and a half, two miles away. I said we had him in sight, then the controller asked me what kind of plane it was. That caught us up, because normally they have all that information. The controller didn\u2019t seem to know anything.\u201d O\u2019Brien reports that the plane is either a 757 or 767 and its silver fuselage means it is probably an American Airlines plane. \u201cThey told us to turn and follow that aircraft\u2014in 20 plus years of flying, I\u2019ve never been asked to do something like that.\u201d  O\u2019Brien and his crew, Maj. Robert Schumacher and flight engineer Master Sgt. Jeffrey Rosenthal, are unaware of the attacks in New York. Schumacher will say that, after being directed to follow Flight 77, he first thought that the plane was having technical difficulties, \u201cthat the pilots were really just trying to fly the airplane, and get it on the ground safely.\u201d After the impact, O\u2019Brien tunes in to a news broadcast, but is surprised to hear about a second crash in New York, not at the Pentagon. He will recall: \u201cThe first thing we heard on there was \u2018We\u2019re now hearing about a second airplane hitting the World Trade Center.\u2019 That was not what we were expecting to hear. We were expecting to hear about an airplane impacting the Pentagon\u2026 and the light goes on, and it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, the nation\u2019s under attack!\u2019\u201d  The 9/11 Commission  will report that O\u2019Brien specifically identifies the hijacked plane as a Boeing 757. Seconds after impact, he reports to the Washington tower, \u201cLooks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon, sir.\u201d  </p>",

At the time of the attack, Rumsfeld is in his office proceeding with his regularly scheduled CIA briefing, despite being aware of the two attacks on the World Trade Center earlier on. Waiting outside his door is Officer Aubrey Davis of the Pentagon police, who is assigned to the defense secretary\u2019s personal bodyguard and has come of his own initiative to move Rumsfeld to a better-protected location. According to Davis, there is \u201can incredibly loud \u2018boom,\u2019\u201d as the Pentagon is struck. Just 15 or 20 seconds later, Rumsfeld walks out of his door looking composed, having already put on the jacket he normally discards when in his office. Davis informs him there is a report of an airplane hitting a section of the Pentagon known as the Mall. Rumsfeld sets off without saying anything or informing any of his command staff where he is going, and heads swiftly toward the Mall. Davis accompanies him, as does Rumsfeld\u2019s other security guard Gilbert Oldach, his communications officer, and the deputy director of security for the secretary\u2019s office. Finding no sign of damage at the Mall, Davis tells Rumsfeld, \u201c[N]ow we\u2019re hearing it\u2019s by the heliport,\u201d which is along the next side of the building. Despite Davis\u2019s protests that he should head back, Rumsfeld continues onward, and they go outside near where the crash occurred.  The Pentagon was hit on the opposite site of the huge building to Rumsfeld\u2019s office.  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke will say that Rumsfeld is \u201cone of the first people\u201d to arrive at the crash scene.  He spends a brief time there .  Rumsfeld will later justify his actions following the attack, saying, \u201cI was going, which seemed to me perfectly logically, towards the scene of the accident to see what could be done and what had happened.\u201d  As journalist Andrew Cockburn will point out, though, \u201c[T]he country was under attack and yet the secretary of defense disappears for 20 minutes.\u201d  John Jester, the chief of the Defense Protective Service, which guards the Pentagon, will criticize Rumsfeld for heading to the crash scene at this time. He will say: \u201cOne of my officers tried to stop him and he just brushed him off. I told [Rumsfeld\u2019s] staff that he should not have done that. He is in the national command authority; he should not have gone to the scene.\u201d  The numerous reports of Rumsfeld going outside to the crash scene are apparently contradicted by counterterrorism \u201ctsar\u201d Richard Clarke. In his 2004 book  <i>Against All Enemies</i>, Clarke will give the impression that Rumsfeld never leaves a video conference for very long after the Pentagon is hit, except to move from one secure teleconferencing studio to another elsewhere in the Pentagon.  However, video footage confirms that Rumsfeld does indeed go to the crash site.  </p>",

He opens the call saying, \u201cAn air attack against North America may be in progress.\u201d He mentions reports of a crash into the opposite side of the Pentagon, and requests that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld be added to the conference.  Rumsfeld has a crucial role to play in coordinating the military response to an attack on the US. According to journalist and author Andrew Cockburn, since the Cold War, \u201cIn an age when an enemy attack might allow only a few minutes for detection and reaction, control of American military power became vested in the National Command Authority, which consists of the president and the secretary of defense. Collectively, the NCA is the ultimate source of military orders, uniquely empowered, among other things, to order the use of nuclear weapons. In time of war, therefore, Rumsfeld was effectively the president\u2019s partner, the direct link to the fighting forces, and all orders had to go through him. Such orders were supposed to be transmitted from\u2026 the National Military Command Center.\u201d Cockburn adds that the NMCC is \u201cthe operational center for any and every crisis, from nuclear war to hijacked airliners.\u201d Yet, rather than join the NMCC conference, Rumsfeld has already gone out of the Pentagon to see the crash site, without telling any of his command staff where he was going, and remains out of contact for some time . Therefore, a few minutes after Leidig makes his request, Rumsfeld\u2019s office will report back that he is nowhere to be found. Cockburn concludes, \u201cThe chain of command was broken.\u201d  It is unknown whether Rumsfeld has a cell phone or pager on him, and if so, why he cannot be reached. </p>",

The claim is reportedly made in an anonymous telephone call to the Arab television station.  It is soon retracted, though. At around 10:00 a.m., a spokesman for the DFLP will deny the group\u2019s responsibility for the attacks .  All the same, the allegation about the group\u2019s involvement will reach a large audience.  The DFLP is a Marxist-Leninist organization that was founded in 1969. It operates mainly in Syria, Lebanon, and the Israeli-occupied territories, and is believed to have about 500 members. It began a relatively small-scale campaign of assaults and bombings in Israel and the occupied territories during the 1970s.  However, it was removed from the US State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations in October 1999 because of \u201cthe absence of terrorist activity\u201d by the group in the previous two years.  </p>",

A colleague of his received a call, informing him that the meeting had been called off, and then shouted down the corridor to Grojean, \u201cYour meeting is canceled.\u201d Grojean therefore turned around and headed back toward his office.

He learned of the first crash in New York while still at home. After seeing the second crash on television, he realized it was a coordinated attack and hurried to work. When he arrived on the NEADS operations floor at around 9:45, the head of the weapons team, Major James Fox, informed him that fighter jets were coming up from Selfridge and Toledo; both sets of jets had been told to contact NEADS and would require instructions.  <br/><u>Marine Calls Murphy</u> - After Murphy reportedly checks in the F-16 pilots from Selfridge Air National Guard Base and gives them orders , his cell phone rings. On the other end is a friend of his from VMFA-321, a Marine Corps Reserve squadron at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland that flies the sophisticated F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet. Murphy\u2019s friend says: \u201cDude, get us in the war.

Its members respond to situations that require the most specialized training, such as hostage taking and water rescue, and use the most advanced equipment.  <br/><u>Officers Are Ordered to Come Down from the WTC</u> - Inspector Ronald Wasson, commanding officer of the ESU, earlier on divided his officers into four teams of five or six men and then sent two teams into each of the Twin Towers to assist the rescue operation.  But now, ESU commanders give the order for the unit\u2019s members to \u201cgo tactical.\u201d This means the officers in the towers have to come out of the buildings and go to the unit\u2019s SWAT (special weapons and tactics) vans; put on their BDU (battle dress uniform) suits, flak jackets, and Kevlar helmets; and arm themselves with heavy weapons and assault rifles. <br/><u>Commander Thinks Terrorists Might Attack the First Responders</u> - The decision to order ESU officers to go tactical is made by Wasson, according to a book by Lieutenant William Keegan of the Port Authority Police Department.  Wasson is currently assembled with a number of other ESU officers outside the Twin Towers, at the corner of West and Vesey Streets.  He decides that ESU officers should go tactical due to his concern that armed terrorists might attack the first responders at the WTC. He is \u201cworried that with all his personnel inside the buildings, he [has] no way to protect the cops, firefighters, or civilians from the kind of low-intensity warfare\u2014snipers, automatic weapons, car bombs, hostage situations\u2014he [is] sure [will] follow the attack,\u201d Keegan will write. He believes it is the responsibility of the New York Fire Department to deal with the fires in the Twin Towers, while the Police Department should be preparing for what might happen next. Many ESU members will come out of the towers after receiving the order to go tactical, according to Keegan.  <br/><u>Order Is Given after an Officer Hears of the Pentagon Attack</u> - However, according to author Anthea Appel, the order to go tactical is made by Sergeant Tom Sullivan, another ESU officer. Sullivan is currently at the corner of West and Vesey Streets along with Wasson, getting ready to take two teams into the WTC. At 9:56 a.m., after hearing over his radio about the attack on the Pentagon, which occurred at 9:37 a.m. .  <br/><u>Order Is Wrong but Saves Lives</u> - The order to go tactical will turn out to be mistaken as there are no attacks by armed terrorists on the first responders at the WTC. However, as a result of it being issued, numerous ESU members will be outside the Twin Towers instead of inside the buildings when the South Tower comes down and many of them will therefore avoid being killed in the collapse. While 14 ESU members will die in the WTC collapses, a far greater number will survive, Keegan will write, \u201cbecause Wasson\u2019s order pulled them out of the towers and saved their lives.\u201d  One ESU member, Detective Frank DeMasi, will conclude that Sullivan \u201cdefinitely saved his life when he made that last-minute decision to switch from rescue to tactical mode,\u201d according to Appel, since the delay while they changed into their combat gear \u201ckept DeMasi and his teammates from walking into the South Tower before it collapsed.\u201d  </p>",

The two men come up with everything that needs to be in place to defend the major cities: the fighter jets required, the altitudes the jets should fly at, the requirements for tanker planes, and the radio frequencies that will be needed. Within minutes, they have pieced together an extensive plan. Murphy and Julian then return to the battle cab, where they set about putting it into action.  </p>",

Felt makes the 911 call using his cell phone.  It is answered by dispatcher John Shaw, on a line at the center specifically for incoming cell phone calls.  Glenn Cramer, a supervisor at the 911 center, hears Shaw responding to the caller, \u201cYou are what hijacked?\u201d and consequently picks up a phone that allows him to listen in on the rest of Felt\u2019s call.  <br/><u>Call Center Workers Mishear Name</u> - Felt identifies himself. Shaw and Cramer apparently mishear, and both will recall that he says his name is \u201cEd Wart.\u201d  (The FBI will initially refuse to disclose the caller\u2019s name to the press, but he is later revealed to have been Edward Felt, a 41-year-old engineer from New Jersey.  ) Felt says, \u201cWe are being hijacked, we are being hijacked!\u201d He repeatedly states that his call is not a hoax.  He says the passengers need help immediately.  <br/><u>Felt Answers Questions about His Flight, but Does Not Describe Hijackers</u> - Shaw asks Felt standard questions, such as where is he? What type of plane is he on? And what has happened?  Felt tells Shaw his cell phone number and says he is on United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco.  He says he is locked in the bathroom of the plane, but does not say if this is its front or rear bathroom. He does not say anything about how many hijackers are on board, nor make any statements about any weapons the hijackers may possess.  Nor does he mention any attempt by the passengers to regain control of the plane.  <br/><u>Felt Describes 'Lots of Passengers,' though Plane Is Mostly Empty</u> - Shaw will recall to the FBI that Felt tells him the plane is loaded with numerous passengers.  Glenn Cramer will similarly tell the FBI that Felt describes \u201clots of passengers\u201d on board.  Yet there are only 37 passengers (including the four hijackers) on Flight 93, constituting just 20 percent of its passenger capacity of 182.  Felt says: \u201cWe\u2019re going down. We\u2019re going down.\u201d  Cramer will say that Felt describes an explosion on the aircraft and smoke coming from it, but others\u2014including Shaw\u2014will deny this .  <br/><u>Call Ends after One Minute</u> - Shaw will tell the FBI the call lasts \u201cless than five minutes\u201d before the line disconnects.  According to other accounts, it lasts just over one minute.  After the call ends, other employees at the Westmoreland County 911 center are instructed to notify the FBI and the FAA about it.  When the FBI arrives at the center, it will immediately take possession of the tape of Felt\u2019s call.  </p>",

Now, however, a spokesman for the DFLP denies that the group was behind the attacks.  The spokesman who issues the denial at this time is apparently Qais Abdel Rahim, the leader of the DFLP. Speaking from the West Bank, Rahim says his group condemns the attacks. \u201cWe are not responsible for this type of terror attack. We are against it,\u201d he says.  <br/><u>Group's Leaders Are Unaware of the Attacks</u> - DFLP officials will subsequently review the group\u2019s worldwide operations to see if the group has any links to the attacks. \u201cI called all the DFLP offices outside Palestine; I made sure they had no connection to the attacks\u2014or even to the media reports,\u201d Abu Laila, a senior figure in the DFLP, will later recall. The group\u2019s leaders will tell him that \u201cthey were not even aware of the attacks.\u201d <br/><u>Official Statement Will Deny Responsibility for the Attacks</u> - The DFLP will issue an official statement later today, denying responsibility for the attacks in the US.  \u201cThe Democratic Front rejects any kind of operation outside of the land of occupied Palestine, away from the immediate battlefield confronting the occupation forces and the armed settlers,\u201d the statement will say. The DFLP will blame the false attribution of responsibility on \u201cthe Israeli security intelligence agencies,\u201d which, it will state, \u201care trying to frame us.\u201d These agencies, according to the statement, \u201corchestrated the set-up to criminalize our struggle because of our fidelity to this struggle, and our sophisticated way of organizing under the leadership of the working class and the progressive people of Palestine.\u201d  <br/><u>Experts Believe that Palestinian Groups Are Not to Blame</u> - Most experts in the US will agree that \u201cno Palestinian faction has the wherewithal to carry out such a coordinated and well-executed series of attacks\u201d as have occurred today, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The pilots belong to the 180th Fighter Wing of the Ohio Air National Guard, which is based at Toledo Express Airport.  <br/><u>Pilot Puzzled by Call</u> - When a weapons technician at NEADS contacts the Toledo unit, his call is answered by F-16 pilot Ed Rinke. The weapons technician says, \u201cWe need you to scramble two airplanes right now.\u201d However, according to author Lynn Spencer, \u201cto Rinke, the order makes no sense.\u201d The Toledo unit \u201cis not an alert squadron and does not report to NEADS.\u201d Rinke is only a part-time pilot, and thinks someone more suitable should be taking the call.

He answers: \u201cYou\u2019re calling Toledo, Ohio. Do you not understand who you\u2019re calling here? Who are you trying to call, because you are obviously calling the wrong people. This is <i>Toledo</i>. We don\u2019t have any alert birds. This is Toledo. Do you understand that?\u201d <br/><u>Commander Takes Call, Orders Launch</u> - Fortunately, the two pilots\u2019 wing commander then takes over the call and responds to it more appropriately. Within minutes, according to Spencer, he will instruct Reed and Rinke to take off in two F-16s.

The FBI later says the business jet was within 20 miles of Flight 93 when it crashed, at an altitude of 37,000 feet, and on its way to Johnstown. It was asked to descend to 5,000 feet to help locate the crash site for the benefit of the responding emergency crews.  Stacey Taylor appears to be the Cleveland Center controller who made the request. She later recalls: \u201cI had another airplane [other than Flight 93] that I was working. And I told him, I said, \u2018Sir,\u2019 I said, \u2018I think we have an aircraft down.\u2019 I said, \u2018This is entirely up to you, but if you\u2019d be willing to fly over the last place that we spotted this airplane\u2014and see if you can see anything.\u2018\u2026 So he flew over and at first he didn\u2019t see anything and then he said, \u2018We see a great big plume or a cloud of smoke.\u2019\u201d  The business jet belongs to VF Corp, a Greensboro, North Carolina clothing firm.  According to David Newell, VF Corp\u2019s director of aviation and travel, Cleveland Center contacted the plane\u2019s copilot Yates Gladwell when it was at an altitude \u201cin the neighborhood of 3,000 to 4,000 ft,\u201d rather than 37,000 feet, as claimed by the FBI. He will add: \u201cThey got down within 1,500 ft. of the ground when they circled. They saw a hole in the ground with smoke coming out of it. They pinpointed the location and then continued on.\u201d  This incident occurs around 40 minutes after the FAA initiated a nationwide ground stop, which required planes in the air to land as soon as reasonable .  However, at least two witnesses say they saw a plane overhead even before the time of the Flight 93 crash, and one of them describes it as \u201cdefinitely military,\u201d rather than a business jet. Also, some will describe it as flying much lower than the Falcon 20 was\u2014just \u201c40 feet above my head,\u201d according to one witness.  </p>",

The FAA\u2019s Washington Center also notified them of a suspicious aircraft flying at high speed toward the White House.

Borgstrom says: \u201cBaltimore [the Washington Center] is saying something about an aircraft over the White House. Any words?\u201d Citino replies: \u201cNegative. Stand by,\u201d and then relays Borgstrom\u2019s message to Major James Fox, the leader of the NEADS weapons team.

NEADS personnel speculate that the unidentified object is probably just a helicopter or smoke from the burning Pentagon. Minutes later, the suspect aircraft will be realized to probably be one of the Langley fighters, mistakenly reported by a Washington Center air traffic controller who was unaware of the military\u2019s scrambles. Citino will comment: \u201cThat was cool. We intercepted our own guys.\u201d  </p>",

Colin Scoggins, the military liaison at the Boston Center in Nashua, New Hampshire, has noticed the large, slow-moving target on his radar screen. It is just off the coast and heading directly for Boston. Concerned as to what the aircraft is, he phones the Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  The facility, known by its call sign, \u201cGiant Killer,\u201d is the Navy air traffic control agency that handles all over-water military operations.  Scoggins says: \u201cWe have a large, slow-moving target approaching Cape Cod and heading for Boston. Do you have it? What is it?\u201d The person at Giant Killer only replies, \u201cWe\u2019re looking,\u201d and then mentions, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fleet of ships heading toward the northeast and an Aegis cruiser [a high-tech warship] on the way.\u201d Scoggins is worried that Giant Killer is unable to specifically identify the target he is seeing on his radar screen. It appears to be flying straight toward the Boston Center. He thinks to himself, \u201cIf I wanted to use airliners to attack a country, I would take out their air traffic control facilities!\u201d Scoggins continues watching the suspicious aircraft on his radar screen. Shortly afterward, the Boston Center will be evacuated after the FAA\u2019s New England regional office calls it and reports an unidentified aircraft heading toward the facility .  This is apparently a different aircraft to the one Scoggins is tracking.  Whether the plane Scoggins is tracking is ever identified is unclear. </p>",

In places the wall is said to bow inward by approximately 55 inches at floor 97, and NIST interprets this bowing to mean that the floors must be sagging.

The plan, Security Control of Air Traffic and Navigation Aids (SCATANA), was developed in the 1960s as a way to clear airspace above the US and off the US coast in the event of a confirmed warning of a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Once it is activated a wartime air traffic priority list is established, allowing essential aircraft and personnel to use the airspace. Among others, this list includes the US president, essential national security staff, aircraft involved in continental defense missions, and airborne command posts.  <br/><u>Eberhart Suggests Limited Version of Plan</u> - Eberhart and his staff suggest implementing the limited version of SCATANA over the air threat conference call. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta immediately concurs.  Unlike a full SCATANA, this modified version allows ground navigation aids to stay on, for the benefit of aircraft that are still airborne. Under the plan, for about the next three days all flights other than military, law enforcement, fire fighters, and medevac, will require approval from the national Defense Department/FAA Air Traffic Services Cell, located within the FAA\u2019s Herndon Command Center.  Notice is sent out to all civil and military air traffic control facilities, informing them that the skies now officially belong to NORAD.  <br/><u>Order Supposedly Made Late Due to Safety Concerns</u> - The SCATANA order is issued over an hour after the FAA ordered all planes down , and after at least three-quarters of them have already landed.  Eberhart will later say the delay is due to safety concerns, because NORAD would have been unable to control US airspace\u2014with over 4,000 planes airborne at the time of the attacks\u2014with its radar capabilities.  Defense Week magazine will suggest SCATANA is not implemented until even later, at around 2:00 p.m. It says NORAD issues a \u201cnotice to airmen\u201d implementing the modified version of SCATANA about five hours after Flight 11 hit the World Trade Center.  </p>",

Although Caine was his unit\u2019s supervisor of flying (SOF) this morning, he decided earlier on that he was going to get airborne, and so Lieutenant Colonel Phil Thompson has taken his place as SOF .

He will later recall that the caller sounds strange, and tell the 9/11 Commission that this is the \u201conly phone call that he\u2019d ever received of that nature in the 10 years he\u2019s been on the job for United.\u201d The maintenance officer presumes that the caller is the plane\u2019s pilot, because this specific type of satellite phone call can only be made from the flight deck of a commercial airliner. However, the caller\u2019s manner of talking is not professional. The number for the London facility would not have been programmed into the phone, so the caller would have needed to type it in. <br/><u>Caller Possibly Being Choked</u> - The maintenance officer subsequently contacts the United Airlines System Aircraft Maintenance Control (SAMC) at San Francisco International Airport to report the strange call. The FBI is already at the SAMC and is made aware of his report. It is informed that the maintenance officer has said the caller from the plane \u201csounded as if they were being choked.\u201d However, when he is interviewed by the 9/11 Commission in November 2003, the maintenance officer will state that \u201cit is difficult to say whether or not the pilot was getting choked.\u201d He will say he \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe this to be the case and doesn\u2019t recall reporting this,\u201d although he will indicate that it is \u201cpossible he previously told someone that it sounded like the person was being choked.\u201d <br/><u>Origin of Call Unknown</u> - The suspicious call comes up as \u201cregistration number unknown.\u201d However, the maintenance officer recognizes it as coming from what he will call a \u201cSat 7 phone,\u201d because, he will say, \u201cthe background noise was characteristic of that type of satellite call.\u201d Typically, Boeing 767s and 777s have the equipment to make \u201cSat 7\u201d calls, although the maintenance officer believes the call is most likely from a 777. The United Airlines legal department will subsequently tell the maintenance officer that \u201cit would be possible to find the station that placed the call, because United must have a record of the phone call.\u201d Satellite phone communication is expensive and each call is itemized when paid for. However, a 9/11 Commission memorandum in November 2003 will state that, at that time, the origin of the call \u201cis still unknown.\u201d <br/><u>Call Unrelated to Two United Airlines Hijackings</u> - According to the maintenance officer, the call is not tape recorded. But according to Richard Belme, a manager at the SAMC, the call is recorded but then only stored for a short time, maybe three months. The maintenance officer\u2019s notes from this day will subsequently be shredded. The 9/11 Commission will conclude that the suspicious call could not have come from either of the two hijacked United Airlines flights because it does not coincide with the timeframe of those flights. Furthermore, United Airlines Flight 93 was a Boeing 757 and so would not have been equipped with the type of phone necessary to make the call. In mid-2003, the aircraft maintenance officer will be told that \u201cthis issue [is] over.\u201d  </p>",

Earlier on, a Marine with VMFA-321 called Trey Murphy, a friend of his who works as a weapons controller at NEADS, to offer his unit\u2019s assistance. Minutes later, Murphy told a general from VMFA-321 who called NEADS, \u201c[W]e could use your airplanes\u201d .  <br/><u>Pilot Gives Incorrect Authentication Code</u> - Now Murphy tries to get the authentication code from one of the Marine pilots who has arrived over Washington, which will show that he is who he says he is, and that his orders are legal. However, the pilot responds with incorrect authentication, giving a code that has too many letters. Murphy again tries to authenticate him, but the pilot responds, \u201cDude, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to tell me.\u201d <br/><u>Weapons Controller Improvises Plan of Action</u> - Murphy quickly realizes what the problem is: The VMFA-321 fighters are not normally part of NORAD, and so do not have NORAD authenticators. Instead, their authenticators are from the Air Combat Command. Realizing this is a problem that will recur as more non-NORAD fighters get airborne, Murphy instructs his fellow weapons controller Michael Julian to help him call the squadron commanders of the non-NORAD jets that are taking off to patrol the Northeast US, so as to resolve the issue. Doing so is critically important because, as author Lynn Spencer will point out, \u201cThe authentication system is set up to ensure that a pilot knows he is being given a valid order, and a pilot cannot legally comply with an order unless he can authenticate it first.\u201d Murphy calls VMFA-321 at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, over a secured line and quickly improvises a plan of action. Soon after, faxes are sent off over secured lines to the squadrons that are launching aircraft, to make sure they all follow this plan. <br/><u>Murphy Checks in Marine Pilots</u> - The Marine pilots that have arrived over Washington have now devised their own plan for checking in with NEADS. Since Murphy is a former Marine, some of them know him and recognize his voice. They have therefore decided they will accept orders from him alone. After one of the pilots insists to another NEADS weapons controller that he will only take orders from Murphy, Murphy gets on the line and checks him in, saying: \u201cAll right! Devil 1-1\u2026 I authenticate.\u2026 You\u2019re in the [combat air patrol]. Here\u2019s your mission.\u2026 I\u2019m turning you over to my controller.\u201d After the pilot responds, \u201cRoger that!\u201d Murphy checks in the rest of the Marine fighters.  </p>",

Rather asks him if pre-positioned explosives could have been used to bring down the Twin Towers. Hauer discounts the possibility, saying: \u201c[M]y sense is that just the velocity of the plane and the fact that you have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned, that the velocity of the plane certainly had an impact on the structure itself. And then the fact that it burned and you had that intense heat probably weakened the structure as well. And I think it was simply the planes hitting the buildings and causing the collapse.\u201d  Why Hauer already believes the plane crashes and subsequent fires alone caused the collapses is unclear. In fact, when he testifies before the 9/11 Commission in 2004, he will be asked whether OEM had, before 9/11, conducted \u201cany planning for what would be the response if a commercial or a private plane were to accidentally [hit] either the World Trade Center or some other building in New York City?\u201d He will reply: \u201cWe had aircraft crash drills on a regular basis.

Yet he will not say that the building collapsing had been considered a possibility.  Rather also asks Hauer if the attacks could have been carried out without state sponsorship.

Because the Pentagon is a crime scene, it is the FBI\u2019s job to gather and document every piece of evidence there.  Special Agent Chris Combs, the FBI\u2019s representative at the crash site, has been setting up the FBI operation since arriving at 9:49 a.m.  Since before 10:00 a.m., the bureau\u2019s evidence recovery team has been arriving. But although every available agent has been paged, many are stuck in traffic, and it will take several hours before the entire FBI contingent makes it to the Pentagon. The FBI also has a fleet of sophisticated command vehicles and helicopters, plus other specialized equipment. But even though the crash site is within the \u201cFBI\u2019s backyard,\u201d according to authors Patrick Creed and Rick Newman, by around 12:15 p.m. none of this has arrived yet. The bureau\u2019s rapid-deployment gear, which includes everything needed to gather and document evidence, is stored in a warehouse in Washington, DC. But with traffic in the region at a standstill, it is almost impossible to get this through the streets to the Pentagon. Chris Combs asks his boss at the FBI\u2019s Washington field office if any helicopters are available to get equipment to the Pentagon quickly. But several choppers at the FBI facility in Quantico, just 30 miles south of the Pentagon, are reserved for specific duties during government emergencies and are currently locked down. And according to Creed and Newman, other government helicopters the bureau relies upon for backup are tied up, though what they are being used for is unstated.  Furthermore, NBC News has reported that the FBI\u2019s top teams have been away from Washington for the last two days for a major training exercise in California . This means about 50 personnel, plus helicopters and equipment, are currently out of place and unavailable.  </p>",

Air Force personnel had been responding to the terrorist attacks in the Operations Center in the basement of the Pentagon. The Air Force\u2019s Crisis Action Team (CAT) was activated in response to the attacks in New York and carried out its activities there .  But as the morning went on, thick smoke from the burning building started coming into the Operations Center and became a major problem. Air Force officials therefore decided to set up a temporary Operations Center at Bolling Air Force Base, just across the Potomac River from the Pentagon. At 12:20 p.m., Air Force leaders and assistants left the Operations Center at the Pentagon, and were flown by helicopter to the replacement facility. Member of the CAT also relocated to the new facility, which is functioning by 1:00 p.m. At the new Operations Center, Air Force Surgeon General Paul Carlton Jr. briefs Roche and Jumper on what medical assistance the Air Force might provide to help the emergency response efforts in New York and the Washington area. The two men approve his plan to send medical personnel and equipment to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, to support the emergency response efforts in New York as required. By 3:00 a.m. on September 12, conditions at the Pentagon will have improved sufficiently for operational command to be moved back to the Air Force\u2019s original Operations Center, and that center will be fully operational again at 5:30 a.m.  </p>",

And freedom will be defended.\u201d He continues: \u201cMake no mistake: The United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts.\u201d He reassures the public that he has been in contact with his colleagues in Washington, DC, and they \u201chave taken all appropriate security precautions to protect the American people. Our military at home and around the world is on high alert status, and we have taken the necessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government.\u201d He says, \u201c[W]e will do whatever is necessary to protect America and Americans.\u201d He concludes his statement, saying: \u201cThe resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake: We will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless.\u201d  <br/><u>Bush Remains at Base after Speech Is Broadcast</u> - After the president\u2019s statement was recorded, Rich Del Haya, a military public relations officer at Barksdale, brought the videotape of it to a TV satellite truck outside the base. A technician there put the tape into a deck to be broadcast. However, the uplink failed twice. Finally, the third broadcast goes out to American TV screens. TV anchors emphasize that the president\u2019s remarks are recorded, not live. \u201cThe implication,\u201d journalist and author Bill Sammon will later write, \u201cwas that the White House had purposely delayed the airing of the tape in order to get a head start on the president\u2019s next secret destination.\u201d  The 9/11 Commission Report will similarly state that \u201cfor security reasons,\u201d Bush\u2019s statement \u201cwas taped and not broadcast live.\u201d  But according to Sammon: \u201c[T]he tape delay had been a function of mere logistics\u2014there were no cables available at Barksdale for a live feed on such short notice. In fact, Bush remained at Barksdale more than half an hour after his taped speech was aired.\u201d  <br/><u>Bush's Delivery of Statement Is 'Not Reassuring'</u> - Some commentators will later be critical of Bush\u2019s performance in delivering his statement. Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward will write: \u201cThe president\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed when he walked in. His performance was not reassuring. He spoke haltingly, mispronouncing several words as he looked down at his notes.\u201d  Howard Fineman of Newsweek will call the speech \u201cthe low point\u201d in the president\u2019s war on terrorism.  Bush will comment that the \u201csentiment\u201d of his speech \u201cwas right, but the setting\u2014a sterile conference room at a military base in Louisiana\u2014did not inspire much confidence.\u201d  </p>",

The OEM\u2019s original EOC, on the 23rd floor of World Trade Center Building 7, was evacuated at around 9:30 a.m. due to a report that more commercial planes were unaccounted for , Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik recommended they use the Police Academy as their command center since, he will later recall, it is \u201ca centrally located building of modest height and design, and an unlikely target if the terrorists should strike again.\u201d Additionally, it has \u201cphones and meeting rooms, and could be secured easily.\u201d Consequently, the academy, on East 20th Street, was selected as the new location for the EOC.  Giuliani and his entourage arrived there at around midday and were soon at work, planning the city\u2019s response to the terrorist attacks.  <br/><u>New Operations Center Is Activated Early in the Afternoon</u> - Meanwhile, the New York Police Department and the OEM set up the new EOC in the library at the academy. In the space of around two and a half hours, the facility is fully operational, with phone lines and computers available, and spaces for at least 30 agencies.  It is activated at around 2:00 p.m., according to a report by Tricia Wachtendorf of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware.  <br/><u>Phones and Computers Keep Going Down</u> - OEM personnel promptly get to work, in collaboration with other agencies, on the logistics of the rescue operation. Among other things, they set about ordering supplies and equipment for the rescue effort, determining where and how they can move in trucks and heavy machinery, and developing plans for how to move and where to locate the steel and debris from the WTC site.  However, they experience problems as they try to carry out their operations. \u201cThe phones kept going down, the little computer network we jerry-rigged kept going down, so everything had to be done with pen and paper,\u201d Henry Jackson, deputy director for administration at the OEM who is responsible for setting up the temporary facility, will complain. The EOC will be located at the Police Academy until September 14, when it will move to a larger space at Pier 92 on the Hudson River.  </p>",

For example, Fire Chief Daniel Nigro explains their decision-making process, saying: \u201cA number of fire officers and companies assessed the damage to the building. The appraisals indicated that the building\u2019s integrity was in serious doubt. I issued the orders to pull back the firefighters and define the collapse zone.\u201d  Fire Chief Frank Fellini says, \u201cWe were concerned that the fires on several floors and the missing steel would result in the building collapsing.\u201d  And Fire Captain Ray Goldbach says, \u201c[W]e made a decision to take all of our units out of 7 World Trade Center because there was a potential for collapse.\u201d  However, some firefighters seem surprised at this decision. When Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen is making his way through hundreds of firefighters who are being held away from the WTC site, he hears complaints like, \u201cIt could take days for that building to come down,\u201d and, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they let us in there?\u201d  When Deputy Fire Chief Nick Visconti is instructing firefighters to evacuate the area, one comment he receives is, \u201c[O]h, that building is never coming down, that didn\u2019t get hit by a plane, why isn\u2019t somebody in there putting the fire out?\u201d  </p>",

He begins the video conference call from a bunker beneath the base. He and Chief of Staff Andrew Card visually communicate directly with Vice President Cheney, National Security Adviser Rice, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, CIA Director Tenet, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, counterterrorism \u201ctsar\u201d Richard Clarke, and others.  According to Clarke, Bush begins the meeting by saying, \u201cI\u2019m coming back to the White House as soon as the plane is fueled. No discussion.\u201d But according to Condoleezza Rice, he begins with the words, \u201cWe\u2019re at war.\u201d Clarke leads a quick review of what has already occurred, and issues that need to be quickly addressed. Bush asks CIA Director Tenet who he thinks is responsible for the day\u2019s attacks. Tenet later recalls, \u201cI told him the same thing I had told the vice president several hours earlier: al-Qaeda. The whole operation looked, smelled, and tasted like bin Laden.\u201d Tenet tells Bush that passenger manifests show that three known al-Qaeda operatives had been on Flight 77. According to Tenet, when he tells the president in particular about Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar (two of the alleged Flight 77 hijackers), Bush gives Mike Morell, his CIA briefer, \u201cone of those \u2018I thought I was supposed to be the first to know\u2019 looks.\u201d (Other evidence indicates the third al-Qaeda operative whose name is on the passenger manifest would be Salem Alhazmi  Tenet tells the meeting that al-Qaeda is \u201cthe only terrorist organization capable of such spectacular, well-coordinated attacks,\u201d and that \u201cIntelligence monitoring had overheard a number of known bin Laden operatives congratulating each other after the attacks. Information collected days earlier but only now being translated indicated that various known operatives around the world anticipated a big event. None specified the day, time, place or method of attack.\u201d Richard Clarke later corroborates that Tenet had at this time told the president he was certain that al-Qaeda was to blame. Yet only six weeks later, in an October 24, 2001 interview, Rice will claim differently. She will say, \u201cIn the first video conference, the assumption that everybody kind of shared was that it was global terrorists.\u2026 I don\u2019t believe anybody said this is likely al-Qaeda. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Tenet also relays a warning the CIA has received from French intelligence, saying another group of terrorists is within US borders and is preparing a second wave of attacks. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld briefs on the status of US forces, and states that about 120 fighters are now above US cities.  The meeting reportedly ends around 4:00-4:15 p.m.  </p>",

It collapses in 6.6 seconds, which is just 0.6 of a second longer than it would have taken a free-falling object dropped from its roof to hit the ground.  Many questions will arise over the cause of its collapse in the coming months and years. Building 7, which was not hit by an airplane, is the first modern, steel-reinforced high-rise to collapse because of fire.  Some will later suggest that the diesel fuel stored in several tanks on the premises may have contributed to the building\u2019s collapse. The building contained a 6,000-gallon tank between its first and second floors and another four tanks, holding as much as 36,000 gallons, below ground level. There were also three smaller tanks on higher floors.  However, the cause of the collapse is uncertain. A 2002 government report will conclude: \u201cThe specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence.\u201d  Some reports indicate that the building may have been deliberately destroyed. Shortly after the collapse, CBS News anchor Dan Rather comments that the collapse is \u201creminiscent of\u2026 when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.\u201d  And moments after the collapse, MSNBC\u2019s Brian Williams joins David Restuccio, an FDNY lieutenant, by phone to ask him about the collapse. \u201cYou guys knew this was coming all day?\u201d asks Williams. Restuccio replies: \u201cWe had heard reports that the building was unstable, and that it would eventually need to come down on its own, or it would be taken down. I would imagine it came down on its own.\u201d Restuccio does not explain what he means by \u201cit would be taken down.\u201d  </p>",

        "content": "<p>Susan Mcelwain, who lives two miles from the Flight 93 crash site, had seen a small jet plane flying very low overhead as she was driving home. She later recalls that it had been \u201cheading right to the point where Flight 93 crashed and must have been there at the very moment it came down.\u201d But it was only later in the afternoon, after returning home and turning on the TV, that she\u2019d realized what she\u2019d seen was connected to the attacks in New York and Washington. While she was confused that a Boeing 757\u2014not a small jet plane\u2014was being reported as having gone down near where she\u2019d been, she\u2019d then realized that the small plane was flying in a different direction to that being described for Flight 93. So she got her husband to tell the police about what she\u2019d witnessed. Consequently, late in the evening, the FBI turns up to talk to her about it. Yet, as Mcelwain later recalls, \u201cThey did not want my story.\u201d They keep asking her how big the plane she\u2019d seen was. When she tells them it was small, not much bigger than her van, one of the agents tells her, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a 757 looks like.\u201d She retorts, \u201cDon\u2019t be condescending towards me. If you don\u2019t want to believe me, that\u2019s fine, but I thought I should report what I saw. You ought to know there was something else in the air at the same time this was going on. We want to make sure it was ours and not somebody else\u2019s.\u201d After this, she will recall, the agent \u201cdid seem to get a little nicer. Told me that it was a white Learjet. Somebody was taking pictures. And I said, \u2018Before the crash?\u2019 and he says, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve got to go,\u2019 and that was the end of it.\u201d  Numerous other witnesses also saw a small jet plane flying above the crash site around the time Flight 93 reportedly went down . </p>",
